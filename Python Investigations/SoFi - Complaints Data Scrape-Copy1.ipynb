They only pulled a soft credit with a credit bureau ; they pre approved me. \\n\\nThen, next step was to send an official application, when they would pulled my credit info from a bureau. In a given screen about immigration status they offered 3 options to be chosen from : XXXX, XXXX XXXX holder, Non-immigrant ( option that would limit the the loan to T {$35000.00} XXXX. I, then, on the same day XX/XX/XXXX, chatted with a customer support representative BEFORE SUBMITTING THE APPLICATION to understand what I should do as my situation is having an EAD/Advance Parole holder with a EB-5 Green Card application approved ( I-140 ) awaiting the card to be issued. I was informed by the agent that if I had the approval letter I could submit my application, as a green card holder. \\nNote : I was logged in so they have that conversation store in their system. \\n\\nI proceed with the application and was approved for up to {$90000.00}. I ended up keeping a {$70000.00} request. Following, they requested me to send me my docs and after a lot of back and forth a agent calledXX/XX/XXXX. stated clearly that I had to submit an I-797 Form with my green card approval to be finally approved. I sent that and after more back and forth the agent XXXX XXXX denied the loan unless I fulfilled this absurd request to add a XXXX or XXXX XX/XX/XXXX holder to my application as a co-signer ( even to get less than {$35000.00}, the opposite of what they stated before ). \\n\\nI refused to do so as I earned a great credit as an individual, paying my bills and taxes diligently and I am the only responsible for my personal finances. Then, they denied my request, left me without the loan and with a credit score hurt by their hard inquiry - even though I presented all documents requested.',\n",

I believe if I did not qualify under SOFI 's standards then the application should have been declined, I should have received a formal notification in writing which would allow me to follow up as a consumer.

I do not understand how the other party involved my daughter the primary applicant received an email that I as the cosigner was ineligible, when I myself as the applicant did not receive proper notice. I believe legally when a consumer applies for credit via a credit application provides all necessary documentation to complete the application the application needs to either be declined or approved and the consumer needs to be formally notified.

I had a checking and savings account with them that has been opened for years. Recently, I also applied for, and was approved for a credit card with them. I activated said card and was declined. I thought that was odd, so I tried once more, and was declined. I received no call from them at all regarding this- which I also found odd. \\n\\nI call and they tell me that my entire account, checking/savings/credit card, has been frozen for suspected fraud. Mind you, my checking account has no transactions whatsoever on them. My credit card was brand new. I had planned to utilize both once I received the card. \\n\\nMy actually issue lies in the fact that reaching someone at SOFI who can give me actual information as to why my account was frozen, or any details at all about my account is near impossible. Reaching a general agent is fine, until you get through and they direct you to reach their fraud team who I can never get through to whatsoever. Immediately when I am transferred, or call the number directly, I am sent to a voicemail box in which I have left 4 voicemails on already on the following dates : XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nI have received no response or correspondence back. I have also asked for their general support team to have a supervisor call me back and have received nothing back in return either. \\n\\nAll accounts are frozen without any reason, ways to resolve the freeze, or ways in which to reach someone who can provide me any information at all.\",\n",

Now, I no longer work at that company, and I make significantly less money, because I'm working for myself, starting a new business. My loan payment is so high, it is more than I pay for my mortgage, and I'm struggling to make my monthly payments. I physically don't have the money to pay such a high amount every month. I've contacted my student loan company, Sofi, several times ( most recently on XX/XX/18 ) to explain that I need to lower my monthly payment to an amount that reflects my new income, but they tell me there's nothing I can do. My account is now delinquent as a result. To make matters worse, they raise my interest rate every month, making this physically impossible to ever day off in my lifetime. I've already paid back the amount I borrowed and then some, ( over the last 13 years ) but still owe the same amount I started with. I'm just looking to simply lower my monthly payment to a reasonable amount that I can keep up with. Please help.\",\n",

They have not even presented any proof that I made the said transaction. XXXX XXXX even told me that I have the card, I made the said transaction which is absurd, First of all, How can I file a complaint without SoFi giving me the said affidavit? I was in the police station to file a complaint but they can not entertain me without the said affidavit of fraud from the credit card company. \\n\\nI have been calling SoFi but we are just running circles. How did they came up such conclusion that I made such fraudulent transaction? Did they even check the IP address that was used if was used via online transaction at XXXX XXXX XXXX?, the phone number that was used to activate the card? did they even check and coordinated with XXXX ' CCTV if I was in the said store if it was done in person? This is just so absurd and I hope I was treated fairly in this matter. They have lapses in judgement making their fraud department unreliable.\",\n",

On XX/XX/2021, I received a call from a SoFi representative stating that my interest rate was increasing to 3.55 % because they were unable to verify my income based upon my pay stub. As instructed, I uploaded my pay stub to my online portal. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/2021, I called SoFi to follow-up on the status. I was informed that the initial 3.05 % rate had expired. I then asked to speak with someone on their escalations team because I did not understand how the rate expired if I followed their instructions and it was SoFi \\'s delay in contacting me to ask for more proof of income. I then spoke with XXXX XXXX on their escalations team to explain the situation and to explain the pay stub and prove that I made the income that I represented. It appears that SoFi was simply looking at my gross income, however, as a travel nurse, I receive tax-free funds that are no included in that gross figure they were going off of. I explained XXXX XXXX that SoFi needs to add up the gross amount as well as the tax-free portion of the pay stub. XXXX XXXX seemingly understood and said that if all of my paperwork was initially in prior to the deadline, then I should receive the 3.05 % rate. She then stated that she would have a \" reviewer \\'\\' look at my file and get back to me ASAP. Immediately thereafter, I also uploaded a new pay stub that I received ( since I was just paid again ) as well as a copy of my bank statement to show how much income I was receiving. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/2021, I received an email from an \" XXXX \\'\\' at SoFi indicating that they can only offer me a 3.55 % interest rate. I emailed XXXX XXXX asking why this was and I received a response from \" XXXX XXXX \\'\\' indicating that the previous rate already expired and that this new rate was based on the income paperwork. This is just going in endless circles even though I accepted a rate of 3.05 % and submitted my necessary proof of income. SoFi appears to be luring consumers in with lower interest rates and then hitting them with a higher rate without any logical explanation- they simply repeat themselves over and over again. \\n\\nTheir delay in processing your application and general incompetence has now forced me to accept a higher interest rate.',\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': \"We refinanced our primary residence mortgage with SoFi. We signed the closing documents on XXXX, on XXXX SoFi failed to payoff the amount due to our previous lender. After much communication with SoFi and the escrow agent XXXX XXXX, SoFi made the payoff to our previous lender on XXXX. SoFi apparently did not close on the loan until XXXX. We have still not recieved our excess escrow funds or an executed copy of our closing documents. On approximately XXXX, we received our first periodic mortgage statement from SoFi dated XXXX with the total amount due and a payment due date of XXXX. Our closing documents included a first payment notice that had an estimated amount due on XXXX. Since the due date of the periodic statement did not match the due date on the estimated first payment we logged into the SoFi system which reflected a due date of XXXX. On XXXX we received an automated call from SoFi stating that we are delinquent on our mortgage payment. I immediately contacted SoFi and explained the only periodic mortgage stated a initial due date of XXXX. On XXXX @ XXXX, XXXX ( # XXXX ) said this was SoFi 's mistake and I would receive a call from SoFi by end of business on XXXX to correct this. I received no call. I called again and on XXXX @ XXXX, XXXX ( # XXXX ) estimated resolution by XXXX, and at my request transferred me to a supervisor. On XXXX @ XXXX, XXXX XXXX ( # XXXX ) told me the loan overview on SoFi 's online system would be update to show the first payment was due XXXX by no later than XXXX and I would receive a call from SoFi by end of business on XXXX confirming the correction. I received no call. On XXXX & XXXX, I checked SoFi 's website and confirmed SoFi did not change in the first payment due date. On XXXX at XXXX, I spoke with XXXX ( # XXXX ) who reviewed the file and tried to reach XXXX XXXX . Without notice, I was transfered to an unnamed voicemail (XXXX ). I left a voicemail at XXXX detailing the issue. After leaving the voicemail, the system hung up on me. I called back the customer service line at XXXX, after waiting 38 minutes, I was transfered to an unnamed voicemail ( XXXX ), but was informed that the voicemail was full and the system hung up on me. On XXXX @ XXXX, I requested assistance through the SoFi website chat feature. I was chatting with XXXX XXXX, but the system disconnected me when I tried to attach a copy of the periodic statement indicating first payment due XXXX, I then chatted with XXXX and XXXX, neither of whom resolved the issue. On XXXX @ XXXX, I requested assistance through the SoFi website chat feature. I chatted with XXXX XXXX XXXX. He advised me that his supervisor said my first payment was due XXXX and SoFi intended to alter the periodic mortgage statement online to now reflect a due date of XXXX and if I paid today then there would be no fee. On XXXX @ XXXX, I paid the full amount alleged to be due on XXXX to ensure I was not delinquent on my loan and subject to a fee. This appears to be a bait and switch by SoFi to subject new mortgagees to fees by providing notice of a date due then changing the date due to an earlier date without notifying the consumer so they miss a payment and are subject to fines. Additionally, SoFi appears to work with an escrow company to improperly withhold excess escrow funds and not timely payoff existing mortgages.\",\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': \"Step 1 : What is this complaint about?\\n\\nSofi 's unfair business practices. Their actions support fraudsters instead of impacted hard working and honest customers such as me when someone fraudulently used my identity to obtain a personal loan in the amount of XXXX. \\n1. I had to make numerous calls to them just to find out if any account was open fraudulently in my name but those calls didn't yield any results. I have proof to backup my claim of a 9 minute call to them ( XXXX ) from my cell phone as early as XX/XX/16. And many more calls but no proper answer and no documents were mailed to my residence. It was only after I disputed the loan account with credit bureaus, the truth in lending act disclosure was sent to me on XX/XX/XXXX for the loan dated XX/XX/XXXX. When challenged, all they had to say was they are a paperless office. Paperless at the cost of a hard working and honest customer such as me? Is this really an acceptable business practice? \\n2. Unlike any other financial institution I interacted with, this company reps won't connect me to their fraud department when I mentioned about my identity being misused by thieves. On the other hand, their response always was their fraud department don't take calls. And they won't call me as well and I really suspect if there's any fraud department. Is it too much to expect a expedited response to halt illegal activities sooner rather than letting it continue? Is it legal or fair business practice to let illegal activities continue or to support thieves? \\n3. From my numerous calls, I got bits and pieces of information. One such information was that loan amount was wire transferred to the fraudulently opened account. They won't give me the bank details or account details even after providing all my information that matched their records. I am afraid their actions could land me in more trouble due to thief misusing these funds for illegal activities. What kind of business practice is it to sanction a loan so easily to a fraudster but won't help stop illegal activities? In my last call yesterday, I told them that I will report their unfair and unethical business practices to federal agencies and here I am doing it with the hope of getting these rectified. \\nStep 2 : What type of problem are you having?\\n\\nA personal loan was sanctioned to a thief using my identity but Sofi continues to put obstacles to slow me from stopping further illegal activities.\\n\\nStep 3 : What happened?\\n\\nLate XX/XX/XXXX, I started getting letters from several banks on my credit card applications and loan application s being rejected. Some bank accounts did get opened too. I called each one of these financial institutions to inform them of my identify being misused and also had them shut down such accounts. But, SoFi failed to act in a timely manner and I am afraid this money and related accounts could have been used fraudulently resulting in terrorism or drugs or other illegal activities.

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'Hello, I applied for a student loan refinance through SoFi on XX/XX/2019. I was denied but the concern lies with the language used in their rejection statement and support from their chat support. \\n\\nSoFi Auto Response : \" We encourage you to apply again if your situation changes at a later date. Examples include getting a promotion, starting a new job, graduating from school, paying down other debt, relocating to a new area, or earning a new degree. \\'\\' They didn\\'t clarify \" my situation \\'\\' so there\\'s no view into what would need to change, but they actually state \" relocating to a new area \\'\\' which is redlining. Is that still legal? \\n\\nI used the SoFi chat function to ask for a 2nd look at my situation. The rep, XXXX ( that\\'s not a typo, that\\'s the name ), said that I could call them up but the response would be the same. I explained that on paper my situation doesn\\'t look great, but would like to know if they do 2nd looks. \\n\\nXXXX said they have minimum eligibility criteria and if I don\\'t meet them then they can not allow me to proceed. The claim was this is a fair lending practice since they can not treat clients differently.\\n\\nSoFi directly communicate they do not practice fair lending. If SoFi really did want to be fair to customers they would do a 2nd look to see if their algorithm missed an opportunity to lend to someone. I work for a bank and we all know the system doesn\\'t always see the whole picture. \\n\\nThe other issue in their response is \" earning a new degree \\'\\'. If I\\'m already in debt from an XXXX degree and I\\'m declined for a refinance, how would additional debt for a 2nd degree put me in a better financial situation? This is an irresponsible response to potential customers.\\n\\nSoFi should be clear as to why customers are rejected, and SoFi should be investigated for redlining.',\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': \"We took out a loan with SoFi to refinance our home loan. We were looking to go to a 15 year loan and get a lower interest rate. The entire process was very difficult. They made promises they then did not honor including advertising and telling us there would not be a origination fee but when it was time to close there was, they just called it an administration fee. They also had to check our credit twice do to them making an error and having my husbands name as one thing during their process but with our prior lender it was spelled a different way causing two checks with our credit report. \\nThroughout the entire loan process there were constant errors in the paperwork and details of the loan. They asked multiple times during the process for proof of flood insurance from our current lender. We sent them our flood documentation including the elevation test and the LOMA that was approved. In 2015 we had been removed from the flood zone by FEMA and no longer required flood insurance. I unfortunately did not save every email interaction with them, however I did find one email from XX/XX/XXXX prior to closing on the loan where we once again informed them we were not in the flood zone. We ended up closing on the loan in XXXX, they had everything they needed and confirmed we did not need flood insurance. \\n\\nIn XXXX I contacted SoFi after closing on our loan to see how to go about getting the XXXX  % interest rate deduction on me and my husbands personal loans ( we had received a post card that if we refinanced with them we would also get a reduction on our personal loans we had with them, we were also advised this early on in the refinance process over the phone ). I was told the person on the phone did not know anything about this. They ended up advising me to get the interest rate reduction I needed to go online and apply for a new loan and use the option/reason to get a lower interest rate. I did this as advised ( causing another credit check against my credit ) and was denied. At the time my credit score was XXXX but they said my score was too low to approve the loan I was requesting because they advised me to request it. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX I sent a complaint to their 'CEO ' which I am fairly sure is not really handled by their CEO. After multiple interactions and finally asking them to pull up the original phone call where we were advised we would get the interest rate reduction, I received an email they could not give us the reduction but they would give us {$50.00} ( the said the reduction would have resulted in {$28.00} savings over the life of the loan ). None of my other concerns were addresses and it was dropped. \\n\\nIn XXXX we began receiving multiple messages stating we needed flood insurance again. My husband and I spoke with multiple people every week. We continued to be advised we just had to send in our LOMA. We would send it in and they would come back and ask again. They could not ever find our account. We ended up sending it to the person who handled the above complaint hoping she could help on XX/XX/XXXX. We never heard a response. The confusion has something to do with SoFi and the company who services their loans not having the same account number. We sent the flood documentation an estimate of 6 times from XXXX through XXXX ( they would call every couple of weeks, we would send it every couple of weeks ). We then began receiving letters stating they would force us into flood insurance and purchase it for us. At this point I had contacted FEMA asking for help who also advised the LOMA is what we should need to send them. We were not getting any help from anyone to understand what we needed to do. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX, I emailed the CEO again, I received a generic email from someone saying someone from the mortgage team would get back to me. I never heard anything back. On XX/XX/XXXX I emailed the 'CEO ' again letting them know I would be contacting CFPB because I did not know what else to do. I again received a generic response stating they would be forwarding it to the mortgage team and someone would get back to me. It is now the XXXX and I still have not heard back from anyone. \\n\\nWe did however receive an email on XX/XX/XXXX notifying us that they had purchased flood insurance using our escrow for {$1700.00}. We have not been advised yet how they will pay our other stuff since our escrow will now not have money in it. I assume we will be getting a bill or something soon. We are begging for help. We thought we were doing everything correctly. We continued to do what we were asked to do which was to send in our LOMA. They would not help us understand what was needed to prevent this and then spent our escrow without our permission. \\n\\nWe do not know if we need to contact a lawyer or what to do next. We did go back to FEMA and are requesting a new LOMA even though we have been advised LOMA 's do not expire. We are in the waiting process for that. \\n\\nAt this point we would like to refinance our loan with a different company but can not afford to pay another {$4000.00} closing costs with a different company. We feel we should have been advised prior to closing that we were going to be required to get flood insurance if we refinanced with them or at least had someone help us to understand what they needed before they just spent our escrow. We feel we took this loan out based on false information from SoFi. I do have some emails that I have kept during this process. Please let me know if there is anything else we need to try to resolve this issue. Thank you for your support.\",\n",

SOFI does NOT care if you are in hardship due to Covid-19. Their only concern is to make more money. At first, they offered no help/forbearance at all, but buckled under pressure after Federal Student loans offered help while Private Student loans did not. So they changed their tune to \" want to help \\'\\' by allowing a 2 month Forbearance, however on the caveat that you would still be accruing interest every day and only get a break on 2 months principle on the back end ( that tells you something right there ). The SOFI reps ( 2 reps, 2 calls ) were very clear that the interest would be paid be paid over the length of the loan. A 3rd rep also had that understanding. XX/XX/XXXX we find out - surprise! Interest payments to be up PAID front over the next 3 months to the tune of an add\\'l ~ {$1400.00}! And they raid the monthly payment on top of that! They flat out LIED to us. Be cautious. We have been with them for 5 years ( XX/XX/XXXX), with 2 Loans ( Parent & Student ) that started at $ XXXX. They have made a TON of interest ofs of us in those 5 years. We have seen the progression from a Company with XXXX founders, that seemed to really want to help ( Social Financing ) to another greedy large-scale Corporation, making more money off the backs of our youth and future of this Country. XXXX is their cohort, we found that out as we struggled to fight for our rights with them. At the end, they & XXXX do not care to stand by their word, or help their borrowers in need during a worldwide PANDEMIC. They said they may consider that in the future, but for now sorry nothing we can do about it. Yes, that is true. Maybe thats how you pay for a new SOFI XXXX Stadium in LA and for all those commercials on TV. Shame on them!',\n",

When I requested further information or someone to talk to regarding this extreme increase they claimed to not have access or know what the rate was based on. A 15 % increase in one day for the exact same application seems extremely predatory? and based entirely on the whims of the company and not the actual market or application. I would like a response from the company which outlines *specifically* the basis for the 15 % increase in set interest rate between my two applications and I would like the inquiry on my credit from this company removed as 1.

I tried working through the escalation team and was met with the same answer : they can not and will not move my due date.

I paid more than double my required monthly payment amount, thinking this would result in a \" paid ahead \\'\\' status where my next payment due date would be advanced into the future. However, after logging into my account and calling customer service, I learned that SOFI does not ever advance payment due dates. They still want a full loan payment next month. I do not think this misleading practice was adequately disclosed, and it is used to lure people into refinancing their federal loans. Prior to refinancing, my federal loans offered this feature, and my loan was always paid ahead by several months, if not years.\\n\\nSOFI reserves the right to \" reamortize \\'\\' a loan which is paid ahead, so that the payment term stays the same, albeit with reduced monthly payment amounts, but refuses to give borrowers the benefit of a \" paid ahead \\'\\' status. They justify this by claiming the reamortization is to avoid a balloon payment at the end of the note. However, if the loan is paid ahead, there is no way there could possibly be a balloon at the end of the term. It is mathematically impossible. This claim is made on their website at : https : //www.sofi.com/faq/ under \" Will making a large payment or additional payments change my monthly due amount? \\'\\' Paid ahead status is useful for building a \" cushion \\'\\' so that you can skip a monthly loan payment, and use your income for an unexpected expense.

When my loan funded on XX/XX/XXXX, SoFi began charging me interest on this large sum the day of funding. However, instead of a wire or ACH transfer to my two refinanced institutions, it seems they mailed checks to pay off these lenders. At least that is what the rep said on the phone today. Essentially, I was paying double interest even though SoFi still had the money in their account. When I emailed SoFi to seek correction, I was told interest on my old loan stops accruing the day before my loan funded ( XX/XX/XXXX ). They were wrong. I was also paying on {$62000.00} of this loan at my previous lender too. SoFi should either send funds via wire or not charge until the checks clear their account. The point of my refinance was to save in interest payments ; not to double down on the amount of interest I am being charged. I called today to correct this and also opt out of third party sales as allowed by the Gramm-Leach Bliley Privacy Act ( GLBA ). SoFi 's notice says I can opt out by calling them or online. When I called, they told me I needed to go to their website. I could n't at the time and asked they perform the opt-out for me. She refused. When I asked for a supervisor, she hung up on me. I should be allowed either method offered and not be bullied into their preferences. I still would like to confirm I am opted out of the California and national solicitations.\",\n",

When was there ever true resolution to an issue posted other than the company did all they needed to do. This has become a soap box for complaints and that seems all that it is. I see nothing being done to fix the issues with all of the companies lending to students who have always been told that education is everything, education is priceless. My education came with a cost and interest fees and they seem to be endless. There is so much debt in this nation because of the interest that is charged to people wanting to learn.\\n\\nIt was reported around the end of XX/XX/XXXX The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau filed a federal lawsuit against XXXX XXXX and two subsidiaries seeking restitution for affected borrowers and money penalties. The report stated : XXXX  cheated struggling borrowers out of their rights to lower their payments \" through shortcuts and deception. \", illegal practices made it harder for some borrowers to repay their student loans, XXXX failed consumers who counted on them to help give a fair chance to pay back student loans, \\'\\' XXXX said in a statement. \" At every stage of repayment, XXXX chose to shortcut and deceive consumers to save on operating costs. \\'\\' The list went on and on.\\n\\nI felt I fell into this category and I attempted to seek relief towards the loans that had been transferred to Sofi/ XXXX from XXXX. I was only seeking fairness and resolution to get ahead and I had not know earlier that XX/XX/XXXX that I could make a formal complaint through CFPB. I asked that XXXX  pay the ridiculous amount of interest accrued during the time they held my loans, my background like many others started this way : In XX/XX/XXXX I applied for a loan to go back to school. My loans had a 2 % interest rate, upon graduation the rate was 7.7 %. I had put off payments towards the loan until graduation in XX/XX/XXXX I was given a variety of information from my lender that was both misleading and unhelpful time and time again. When I graduated my loans had accumulated to XXXX   dollars, I did what I could to start to pay back the debt but never could get ahead. In XX/XX/XXXX XXXX finally informed me about the income based repayment and for 3-4 years I made payments totaling almost 13 thousand however my loans gained XXXX of interest over the period of time and I now owed XXXX.\\n\\nI had no choice but to refinance with another lender, Sofi/ XXXX . When I refinanced the loan after the payments I had made for three years the total amount was for XXXX dollars. Sofi seemed the better option with structured payments, it seemed to be my only option of clearing my debt someday. I was poorly informed and I feel defrauded by XXXX XXXX/ XXXX. My claim submission reply through the CFPB website from the company was that they had billed everything correctly on their end, that\\'s it.\\n\\nXXXX  created obstacles, and misinformed me throughout the history of my loans making paying the loans down impossible. Now Sofi/ XXXX have my loan and the one rep I had spoken to stated that people have loans forever. Who wants to live like that, how is that something to look forward to? Sofi/ XXXX have no income based repayment program setup and I currently can not afford to make payments on my loan.',\n",

In addition to tax purposes, I should have received this documentation in timely manner during the period between closing on XX/XX/XXXX, and funding, contractually XX/XX/XXXX, but did not actually occur until XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nWhile getting the settlement documentation is my complaint, it is worth mentioning that this is not the first issue I have had with the lender. The loan was delayed numerous times due to mistakes, omissions, and poor communication since we began the process in XXXX of XXXX. This includes not ordering payoffs in time, overlooking uploaded documents, repeatedly using the wrong numbers on disclosures even after I had pointed out the issues, and making that same mistake during our first closing that required a 're-do '. \\n\\nWe originally closed on XX/XX/XXXX. We noted errors in the closing documents - changes had been made since we signed the final disclosures the previous week. After spending an over an hour trying to contact someone at the lender by phone, we finally reached someone who acknowledged the mistake, advised us to sign but not fund, and we'd receive a correction on XX/XX/XXXX. We did not receive a correction and when I contacted the lender to request it, we were told there were additional mistakes in the closing documents ( dates were wrong ) and we'd need to close again.\",\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'I began the process to refinance my home in early XXXX. After shopping several lenders, I chose to proceed with SoFi, as they had quoted me a 15 year mortgage at 2.25 %. I discussed this with the loan officer XXXX XXXX  and he verbally told me that the 2.25 % was locked for 60 days. \\n\\nShortly after this, Texas experienced a severe ice storm and I was without power and reliable access to email for almost a week. The two weeks immediately following this were extremely busy for me as I am an engineer in the power industry. \\n\\nWhen I resumed working on my loan application in early XXXX I was told that my loan application had been withdrawn for failure to provide a W2 and recent pay stubs. I never received these requests, and when I searched my inbox I found that XXXX had quarantined them as suspicious, since they were sent using a 3rd party application and were flagged as likely phishing attempts. \\n\\nMr. XXXX then explained that I was not locked at 2.25 % as he had led me to believe. He then created a new loan at 2.625 %, half a percentage point higher than previous. I was unhappy, but this was still a lower rate than my current mortgage so I continued with the application. \\n\\nMr. XXXX XXXX began handling most of the paperwork from this point on. Some of the issues with Mr . XXXX include : - Providing me the wrong email address to request a payoff quote from my current lender. This delayed the application by nearly a week, since he did not respond for several days when I informed him of the bounce. He then wanted me to call in and sit on hold during a very busy workday to expedite the payoff request. \\n-One version of the disclosure form had the wrong school district and county listed for the escrow account. I raised this concern several times beginning in early XXXX and still have not received acknowledgement of this error. \\n-For the employment verification, I clearly explained that my local work address is just a field office and that the HR department is located in another state. I provided the phone number for HR. Instead, Mr . XXXX performed a XXXX search and called the number listed for my local field office. This led him to speak to a salesperson, whom he proceeded to ask several personal questions about my income, job performance, bonus pay, etc. This was a gross violation of my privacy. The salesperson to whom he spoke is a subordinate of mine. My salesperson asked Mr . XXXX to instead contact HR, but Mr . XXXX was insistent and went on to discuss personal details of my finances with someone who works under me. \\n-Upon confronting Mr . XXXX about the violation of my privacy during the improper phone call to my salesperson, Mr XXXX XXXX accused my salesperson of lying to me about what was said in the call, despite the completed questionnaire showing the answers to these exact questions as filled out by Mr XXXX XXXX. \\n\\nFinally, today Mr . XXXX provided me with the details of the final closing, which has already been delayed. The interest rate quoted is now a FULL PERCENTAGE POINT higher at 3.625 %. This is equal to my current mortgage. I strongly suspect that much of the incompetence I experienced was designed to delay the loan process so that the 60  day rate lock expired and enabled SoFi to raise my rate significantly at the last minute.',\n",

In order to start the process i had to get appraisal done and i paid SoFI {$520.00} to have appraisal scheduled. \\nAppraiser came on XX/XX/2021. In his report i found mistakes that would affect the comparable and value of the house. The mistakes i found were 1. Missing half bath, misreporting of updates by saying no major updates done in last 15 years where as complete first floor remodel was done in last 2 years plus second floor flooring and paint. At first when i brought this up SoFI loan officers did not understand and told me i needed to provide them with list of houses that would be comparable and all the details in \" reconsideration of value \\'\\' document if I want to try to have the appraiser review his findings. Even after paying the money for appraisal i was told to fix the problem. They told me that because the underwriting had accepted the appraisal they can not do anything. i had lost my trust in the company at this point as they are accepting falsely documented information for such a big transaction. At this point i wanted to get my refund for the appraisal so i can go somewhere else for my refinance needs. They took long time to resolve the appraisal issue and that caused me immense stress and missed opportunity to get a good rate in timely manner. They insisted on fixing the report saying the value does not change since the missing info is not significant. Even though they gave me updated report it was prepared for SoFI and it is useless for me. I am still under distress because of this issue. Their own team is sending me decision that the mistakes on the report was not significant and we have decided to not refund the money. I believe that if it was the other way around and by mistake my house value was more because of an additional bath, they would have said it was significant and take money off so they can give me higher rate. I believe, they should refund me my money but I am really looking for an impartial 3rd party to give me a good reason why the company does not need to give me a refund. So i can move on and never work with them again. Thank you',\n",

A representative from SoFi informed me on the phone that if I have a Sofi Savings Account, I will get a 0.125 % discount for my student loan refinance. So I did. I opened the savings account. When my loan was funded, I see now that the promised 0.125 % discount never materialized. When I called SoFi, they said that I needed to have a positive balance in the Savings Account. I mentioned to the representative that no one said anything to me on the required balance amount. The representative said even a {$1.00} of balance would have helped you with your discount. \\n\\nSo basically based on the miss-information and the promise of the 0.125 % discount that Sofi provided, I moved to SoFi. Not only I did not get it, but also the representative did not even try to work out a solution. SoFi has the recordings from that day and if you listen to it, you will hear the miss-information. I have attached the recording from my conversation with SoFi representative that he agreed for me to record from today 's call. \\n\\nThis is not right that a company gets away from giving miss information and the consumer is left alone to the corner after they get my business. I could have gone to another company with a lower rate like XXXX XXXX, but choose SoFi based on the additional discount.\",\n",

I submitted all required paperwork, as did my cosigner ( my spouse who is on a XXXX XXXX through marriage ). After two weeks of hearing nothing from XXXX, I contacted them multiple times at the end of XXXX -- both on the phone and through their live chat -- to discuss what the hold up was. It was uncovered that they were having an issue contacting my future employer to verify my offer letter. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called them in person after spending a few hours of my own time to find additional contact information for my new company 's HR. I was told then that the application was complete and would finish processing in shortly. The next day, I got hit with an address verification request for documentation because we had just moved. XXXX stated that they would only accept a bank statement, but I had not received one with the new address because we had just moved a few days prior. Once I told them this, they decided that they were willing to a screenshot of my bank 's website showing the updated address. That same day, I logged in and noticed that XXXX had unilaterally updated my requested loan amount from ~58,000 to over 80,000, which I at no point requested them to do. It took two phone calls and three web-based live chats to get this problem solved. Then, this morning, XX/XX/XXXX, they requested an XXXX for my spouse, who was acting as my co-signer so that we could get a better interest rate. We have only been married for two years and have not yet been required by the USCIS to file the XXXX, as my spouse 's initial XXXX XXXX still has validity. Had SoFi told us in their application materials that we would need an XXXX, we would never have filed the application. Their omission of this during the initial stages of the application has led to considerable wasted time on my end and has dinged both of our credit reports with hard inquiries. Today, XX/XX/XXXX, I called into XXXX and spoke to a supervisor for the third time in two days about my application. They told me that if I could not furnish an XXXX they could not move forward with my application. At no point prior to this, not even in my various phone calls and web chats with them about this application did they mention this possibility or that they would need this document. Today, I talked to XXXX, one of XXXX 's supervisors. When it became clear that they were not willing to work with me on this issue, I notified her that I expected XXXX to immediately remove the hard inquiries from both mine and my co-signer 's credit reports and that I would be filing a CFPB complaint.\",\n",

Once I checked my account that day and saw the fraudulent charges and transfers, I immediately filed disputes for all fraudulent charges and transfers that had been taken out up to that point. I also instructed the customer service team to freeze/restrict my account so no further damage could be done and no more money could be stolen. I was instructed to call back to file the rest of the disputes the next day on XX/XX/XXXX because they couldnt file disputes while charges were still pending. I woke up the next morning to another {$5600.00} taken from my account. SoFi did not freeze/restrict my account as I instructed which allowed more money to be stolen. By that time the hackers had stolen {$10000.00} in funds from my SoFi money account. I filed a police report for felony grand larceny on the XXXX when I was able to show evidence of all fraudulent transactions to the police. I then sent the police report to the fraud department at SoFi. After over two weeks of zero contact from them via phone or email despite my many calls and emails to them, they denied all disputes saying they see no evidence of errors. Every person I spoke to from the customer service department said its very evident its fraud but that decision is up to the security/fraud department . And now my account is frozen while they investigate. Which means I have no access to the remaining funds in my SoFi money account. I have done everything humanly possible to demonstrate this is fraud at a high level and SoFi still denied my fraud claims. They tout their platform as very safe and zero fraud liability for their customers. Which is the exact opposite of my experience with them. My life savings was stolen from me and they are doing nothing to help me as a SoFi customer. I want this investigated and I want everyone to know how awful SoFi is.',\n",

The only so-called deferment offered to me involves \" interest only payments \\'\\' based on the interest bills provided monthly. Payments received during the deferment period will be applied to accrued and outstanding interest and then to my principal balance. I used to pay around 700 $ monthly before deferment. In my first three month of deferment from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, I have paid roughly 550 , 500 , 730 , and 420 $ respectively on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX! THEY CALL THIS A DEFERMENT? This is a total rip-off! I need to resubmit all the paperwork every three months because there are no options to submit my documents for an entire academic year and I lost the chance to do so in XXXX because the school was closed from XXXX  XXXX. I submitted a second application in XXXX  XXXX which was approved on XX/XX/XXXX. Being more cautious and proactive, I made a call asking if I am gon na need to make an interest payment by the XXXX XXXX XXXX informing them that my account shows \" zero \\'\\' due amount. I was told they are calculating my interest amount and that most likely I would not need to make a payment and if I do they will notify me within a reasonable amount of time in advance ... and I get a message on XX/XX/XXXX that I need to make a XXXX $ payment on XX/XX/XXXX. They do not even have the decency to notify you in time. This is the best example of a terrible customer service. I am spending more time worrying and handling my student loan that focusing on studying. Had I known they are so defective, I would have never signed up for their services.

To this I have received only one email telling me they didn't know the exact time someone would reach out to me. It is very frustrating to be told to contact people regarding your security and money and no one responds for two weeks and it has forced me to take this outside of the communication with the company and find third party assistance.

I tried to call other departments to talk to anyone but because my account is frozen they automatically send me back to the Fraud Prevention Team. \\n\\n2.

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'I initiated a mortgage refinance loan with Sofi on XX/XX/2020 and was told that it would take approximately 60 days to close ; however the loan is still not closed due to repeated mistakes on their part. I am not submitting any documents or records for this complaint, since all of the issues I am describing can be verified by documents in my Sofi account portal and through emails with Sofi staff that have handled my loan. \\n\\nI submitted all required paperwork for the loan to them on XX/XX/XXXX and had the home inspection was completed by XX/XX/XXXX. We received conditional approval for the loan on XX/XX/XXXX, on which day we also submitted contact information for employment verifications. At that time I was told that no additional paper work or information was needed from me and that the loan would go through regular processing channels ; however from that point forward until today Sofi has made error after error which has resulted in a routine mortgage refinance taking almost 6 months. Below is a summary list of the issues that we have had with Sofi : 1 ) Staff do not routinely return phone calls, voice mails or emails. They do not acknowledge receipt of paperwork, information or requests for assistance/clarifications.\\n\\n2 ) Staff routinely lose or fail to file paperwork and information that they collect ( employer verifications, documents that come to them directly from current mortgage holder etc ), which results in the applicant needed to follow up on their behalf and to request the same documents/information multiple times from employers, mortgage companies, city tax offices etc.\\n\\n3 ) The process for managing the loan is completely unclear and staff are unable/unwilling to explain who/which offices or departments are responsible for the loan during different points in the timeline. The initial \" loan officer \\'\\' is a person that seem to have no actual engagement with the loan after the preliminary paperwork is signed. He is the only point of contact for whom an email and phone number are provided, yet he is completely unreachable. I had to comb through the Sofi website and make dozens of calls to any phone number I could find on the website to get connected to managers of the various departments that handle the process. The amount of effort I have had to exert to get information and feedback from this company is ridiculous.\\n\\n4 ) Despite Sofi senior staff admitting that they have made major mistakes with my loan, they do not seem to have capacity to oversee the processing to ensure that it moves forward efficiently and effectively. Each time there was a problem they assured me that they would address it immediately ; however even if they resolved one issue, others arose due to staff who seemed inexperienced and/or did not review the information diligently. At various times it seems that the staff managing the process lost track of my application or were so overwhelmed with other work that they could not follow up with me for weeks. This resulted in the interest rate being extended five times and my family having to submit 12 sets of paystubs and 6 months of mortgage and bank statements ( so far ).\\n\\n5 ) Some of the most egregious problems that have occurred so far include what may be considered as predatory lending practices ; 1 ) failure of Sofi to send us ANY closing documents until 3pm of the day that we were scheduled to sign the documents in front of a notary at 5pm ; 2 ) the closing documents that were sent were incomplete and did not contain information on the monthly payment that was due ; 3 ) the closing documents stated that we needed to provide {$2600.00} cash at close, which was not what had been agreed upon in multiple earlier conversations and emails ; 4 ) the failure of Sofi to provide a SINGLE person who could answer any of our questions after we received the incomplete and inaccurate CD ( two staff that were responsible for my loan were on leave and the other was unreachable ) ; 5 ) inability on the part of Sofi to cancel the notary appointment ( that they scheduled ) after I emailed everyone to let them know that we could not sign the documents since we had not been able to review them fully or get answers to our questions ; 6 ) pressure from the notary that they hired to sign the documents ( he claimed that he could not leave my house without either the signed documents or instructions from the loan officer - of course he could not get in touch with the loan officer ) and ; 7 ) learning after the closing fiasco that the {$2600.00} cash at closing was to cover city taxes- which had already been paid in full by the current mortgage company.',\n",

Why is the company unable to provide a notification from their system to the consumer alerting an additional fee or payment upon selecting the option? Why cant the company show me I in fact received this notification or went it was sent. The company sends me notifications all the time regarding payments, balances, changes to my loan ... but no notification in my alert section about this double payment in selecting a new payment date if outside of 15 days.

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'I am writing to you to raise a concern about the application process that resulted in my application for a student loan refinance being denied after having been originally pre-qualified. The process was quite frankly humiliating and predatory because of the lack of response/awareness of SOFIs customer service team. I detail my experience because I believe this is a failure that shouldnt be repeated with other customers. \\n\\nApplication for Student Loan Refinance. I applied for a refinance of my student loan online at www.sofi.com on XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$10000.00}. My motivation for doing this is that my credit has improved since I first received the original loan, and I wanted to decrease my interest rate. I received an immediate response from SOFI that I was pre-qualified to refinance my loan with a new rate of 4.864 %, with a monthly payment of approx. {$200.00} for 5 years, and I was asked to provide my checking account information for payment of my monthly payment ( Attachment 1 ). I was very happy with these terms and looked forward to completing this process. \\n\\nOn the week of XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted SOFI several times, to provide things like my paystub, and also to inquire about 2 missed calls that I had from SOFI that week ( the calls came in when I was working ). However, every time that I reached customer service, I was informed that there were no actions items for me to complete, and that the application was being reviewed. I was patient, until by surprise on Saturday XX/XX/XXXX I received a notification via email that my loan application was denied. At first, the letter did not specify a reason for this denial and instead to contact SOFI for the reasoning behind this. \\n\\nAfter contacting customer service, the system stated that my application was denied because my identity could not be verified. I was shocked, since in the 5 exchanges I had with customer service agents that week, none of them informed me that SOFI needed to confirm my identity.\\n\\nPredatory/Deceptive Practices by SOFI. After receiving this notification, I called again and specifically asked about the problem with verifying my identity. The SOFI customer agent stated that because I have an identity fraud alert in my credit profile ( my information was indeed hacked in the famed XXXX  XXXX XXXX of XXXX and subsequently found in the dark web ), SOFI needed to verify my identity. But because I did not pick up the phone when SOFI called, the system had automatically denied my application and there was no way to recall this application even though I was ready to provide whichever verification was needed. Then the customer service agent told me the only way to re-start the process was to complete a new application. I was concerned but re-applied, but here comes the kicker : I was denied. \\n\\nConclusion. As a consumer, the lack of response from SOFI, by keeping my in the dark, and by the mixed messages that I received from customer service agents that somehow lacked the proper training to understand my application and convey accurate information about what was needed resulted in my first application being denied, and subsequently, after denying my application and telling me that because of this I needed to submit a new application, I was denied again really impacted me emotionally. \\n\\nI had a lot pending in this restructuring of my debts, and to me it feels SOFI took me for a ride. The situation that forced the denial of my first application, and then deceived me into believing I just needed to re-apply when in reality an automatic denial was waiting for me ( we dont event need to pull your credit a second time I was told by the customer service agent in an effort to convince to reapply ). \\n\\nAll of this feels predatory, and even much more so when it touches my financial well-being. SOFI markets to young professionals like myself with messages in your website that there arent Hidden fees, No Catch and Fast/Easy/All Online Applications. Well in my case, SOFi ran a hard credit pull, bated me into applying twice, and the process was far from fast, easy or fully online. \\n\\nVery Respectfully, XXXX XXXX',\n",

I submitted my retirement savings for income verification and was denied. I was not offered the opportunity to have a co-signer or to verify additional income. \\n\\nMy complaint is regarding sex discrimination. \\n\\nMy husband applied for a personal loan through SoFi a week or two prior to my application. He too is retired and submitted our combined retirement account statements as income verification. He was approved, no questions, no need for co-signer, no additional documentation needed. \\n\\nI spoke to SoFi this morning and expressed my concern for how my loan was processed and they spoke with both my husband and I on this call. They did not have a good explanation of why they could use my retirement account to verify his income, however, they could not or would not do the same for my loan. \\n\\nI am very disappointed to have been treated unfairly and with bias toward being a woman. I appreciate you looking into this situation.',\n",

I started this process and selected their company as they offered a competitive rate ( historic lows ) and low closing costs. I would have selected another bank in fact if their closing costs they represented were actually accurate to what they then modified throughout the process - as their rate was not the lowest. Since XXXX, I am still in the closing process, and have in fact had my closing scheduled and canceled Bc of disorganization or what appears now to be discriminatory behavior on their end. The amount of documentation, and verified, credit cards information, multiple credit runs, employment verification over and over this 5 month process has been unimaginable. I have complied in every attempt to make this work, but it appears this bank does not want to proceed with this refinance for some reasons. I have excellent credit, payment history and employment, so there is no reason this loan should be denied. Im at a loss and frustrated that i have not been afforded the opportunity to get a more competitive rate in the market Bc of the actions of this company. The have lied throughout the processes making it impossible for me to move on to another institution to take advantages of the rates in a timely manner.

Potential borrowers like myself receive these mailings are enticed to apply because the offer is *apparently* too good to be true, and instead we waste a hard inquiry on our credit report. The substance of my financial position has actually improved since I first started receiving these mailings a year ago, but that had no impact on application. \\nMost importantly, when I asked why my loan was denied, I was told by SoFi that it was because I had a missed payment on my credit history. However, I know the date that SoFi made the hard credit inquiry ( once I had submitted my application ), and they came back to me AFTER that Inquiry and asked me to supply more financial documentation not originally asked for in my initial application.

Again, I spoke to a Sofi customer service agent, this time on their chat service, and he confirmed they offered rate match. He even walked me through the process of where to upload the competitive offer document. At NO point, did either agent state that Sofi still had to review the rate and evaluate IF they would mate. Just that they matched. \\n\\nBased on the agent 's information, we decided to place our formal application with Sofi and included a hard pull on my husband 's bureau, impacting his credit score. \\n\\nAfter the submission, we were told that Sofi would not honor the competitive rate as a new policy launched in early XXXX no longer allowed them to go below their lowest offered rate. This meant that they in fact did not rate match in our situation. \\n\\nI proceeded to call in and explain how this was misleading marketing and at no point, did the service agent explain this. In fact, they lead me to believe the competitor rate would be honored no problem. This feels 100 % as a bait & switch and predatory lending. \\n\\nIf we had been told the company 's actual policy, we would not have submitted an application with Sofi and all would be ok. Instead, the company will not honor our conversation with their agents and after further review, has turned down our rate match. \\n\\nThis is exactly what I believe the CFPB is here to help consumers with since they companies are more powerful than an individual person and I have no leverage to hold them accountable for this misleading practice.\",\n",

SoFi was running a promotional bonus offer to receive {$590.00} for applying for and being approved for a personal loan, during the time that I applied and was approved for my specific personal loan. \\n\\nI live chatted with a SoFi representative online in late XX/XX/2022 to inquire on the status of my {$590.00} promotional bonus amount, as it had not yet been credited to me. The representative explained that the bonus would typically be deposited to a SoFi Money account, however I informed the representative that I attempted to apply for a SoFi Money account the day before, but was denied. The representative then explained that as an alternative, I could sign a Form XXXX and provide the XXXX details of XXXX of my external checking accounts, in order to receive the {$590.00} bonus to my external account. While still connected to this representative on the live chat, I navigated to the section of SoFi 's website that the representative guided me to, where I electronically signed/dated the Form XXXX and entered the account and routing number of my XXXX XXXX checking account XXXX I was then told by the representative I would receive the {$590.00} bonus within XXXX days of when my loan was approved/funded. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/2022, which was XXXX days elapsed from the time of my personal loan being funded back on XX/XX/2022, I still had not received the {$590.00} bonus to my external XXXX XXXX checking account.

The representative did not provide any helpful information as to why my bonus had not been paid out to me- considering that I met the requirements of the offer in terms of applying for and being approved for a personal loan, and having signed the necessary XXXX and provided my external account details for XXXX. The representative told me that opened a ticket for me ( Ticket number : XXXX ) and that the relevant team would look into the matter of crediting my bonus to me within the next couple days. \\n\\nNow, it is currently XX/XX/2022, and I have not received any update from SoFi on my open ticket number, and I still have not received the {$590.00} bonus to my external checking account as part of this promotional offer that I took part in, and it is well past the XXXX day mark that SoFi informed me I would have received this bonus by. \\n\\nTherefore, I am filing this complaint to formally request that SoFi honor the {$590.00} bonus be paid out to me as per the offer I engaged in and fulfilled all requirements from my end.\",\n",

I reviewed the information and determined that it was a fraudulent loan application and therefore opened a case with the credit monitoring service. A representative from the credit monitoring service called me and we placed a conference call to SoFi Lending who made the credit inquiry. The various representatives and supervisors we spoke were unable to locate the loan appliction using my email address and phone number. Since criminals would likely use their own email address and phone number as to not tip off the person they are trying to scam, they obviously were not able to find any loans using that data. We continually asked if they could look it up using my social security number to which they said they can not. This seem rediculous considering that is the information that was used for them to pull my credit in the first place. Since the loan does not show as being opened at this point it was our hope to be able to stop the loan from being opened and reported on my credit. The representatives from SoFi continually told us that they aren't able to search by social security number so therefore we would simply need to wait for the loan to fund, then file a police report and then dispute it with all of the credit bureaus. It seems that their system is set up to enable fruad instead of stopping it. While I don't know the rationale behind these policies I'm guessing it is financial in some way, shape or form. Why can a company pull my credit using my social security number, but not be able to look up a pending loan application using that same information and prevent fraud from happening. What a terrible company. If criminals are reading this then I'm sure they know that if they want to commit fraud, SoFi is the place to do it.\",\n",

Despite the fact that I have excellent credit and a steady income, repeated outreach to SoFi to confirm my application was complete, and multiple assurances from SoFi that my application was under review, SoFi allowed my application to expire without approving it and required me to reapply for a loan at which point the rate SoFi offered went up. This omission on SoFi 's part will cost me several XXXX dollars over the life of my loan. I have asked the company to adjust my rate given the error on their end and they have refused. \\n\\nThe initial rate I received for my student loan refinance was 3.35 % after a .25 % auto-pay discount, and this rate was good until XX/XX/2020. In early XXXX, I received a communication from SoFi that they needed me to upload a more recent paystub, which I promptly did. \\n\\nOver the course of the month of XXXX, I reached out at least 3 times to SoFi via phone and by using the customer service chat feature on the SoFi website. Each time, I asked the SoFi representative whether more information was needed for my application and I asked them to provide a status update on my application. Each time, I was told that there was no additional information needed and my application was in a state of final review. I was told that applications typically turn around in a matter of days when income is straightforward ( my income is very straightforward ; I am employed full time as an XXXX  at a XXXX  XXXX company and do not receive any other income ). \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from SoFi stating that my application had been denied. It also stated that SoFi ran my credit and that the credit report showed my credit score as XXXX. Given that I have excellent credit and a steady income, I was shocked to learn my application had been denied. I reached out to SoFi on XX/XX/XXXX to request a statement of the specific reasons of the denial. In that conversation, I was told that my application was not denied, in fact the application had expired. \\n\\nI asked to speak with an account specialist, with whom I shared the facts of my case : I applied and was quoted a rate of 3.35 %, I finalized my application and submitted all the necessary information, and followed up at least 3 times with SoFi to confirm they had everything needed. I asked the account specialist to reopen my application. The account specialist told me that he could not reopen my application, and directed me to submit a new application, which I did. \\n\\nThe new application came back with a rate of 3.49 % after the .25 % autopay discount. I requested contacted the account specialist again via email to request a rate adjustment since the rate I was quoted on XX/XX/XXXX was .14 % higher than the rate I was moving forward with earlier in XXXX ; he told me that they would not be able to adjust my rate. \\n\\nThe amount of the loan I am seeking to refinance is a little over {$70000.00}, so this interest rate adjustment will cost me several XXXX dollars over the life of the loan. \\n\\nI would like the CFPB to investigate this issue. I believe it is unfair that the company let my application expire despite repeated outreach from me, and they required me to reapply at which point I got a higher rate which has a financial impact on me. \\n\\nThank you.\",\n",

It then told me that with my dad, I would save 0.41 % on the interest rate, with the new rate being 5.115 % with automatic payment. That sounded good so I uploaded my income documents and a copy of my drivers license and told my dad that when I went out to his house, I was going to need the same from him. After I uploaded my documents, it came back and told me that I could get 5.115 % with or without a co-signer. This did n't sound right so I called SoFi as well. The representative confirmed that I would get the same rate with or without. So I decided to proceed without. \\nOver basically the next 2 weeks, XXXX requested various documents including a letter from my father indicating that the original loan was a XXXX loan. Why did they not ask for all this at once? My father is XXXX and does not scan / email documents so I had to drive an hour one way to his house to get documents that would have been a lot easier if they asked for when I originally told them it was a PLUS loan and they asked for a letter of direction. \\nFinally, after 2 weeks ( in which they indicate it is about a 4 day process ), I received notification that a new offer was on my loan. When I contacted XXXX, I find out that since I removed my father from the loan, the income went down and so my rate was going up to 5.525 % with automatic payment. \\nThey never said XXXX word when I talked to them about my father being removed that I needed his income to qualify for that rate. They have known what my income was for over 2 weeks. \\nI sent an email to their customer service and did not get a reply so I logged on and chatted with a representative. She reviewed my information and agreed that I was told wrong information but said there was nothing they could do but I could add my father back if I wanted. I am not drive another hour one way to get a paystub and drivers license when I could have done that with the previous trip. \\nShe then advised me to call in. I strictly told her that if I am calling in to get the same information I would not be happy. She said to call. \\nI called in and the representative told me the exact same information. \\nI told both representatives that this appears to be deceptive and unfair, a complete bait and switch, and that I was filing a complaint with the CFPB ; however they said there was nothing they could do.\",\n",

SoFi soft pulled my credit report and I was indeed preapproved, they displayed the amount and the interest rate I was preapproved for. Based on that, I decided to proceed with my application. During the application process, they requested that I upload live photos of the front and back of my drivers license, they sent a link to my cell phone that asked me for permission to open the camera and take the photos. The application went under review. On XX/XX/2021, they hard pulled my XXXX report. On XX/XX/2021, I received a phone call from XXXX at XXXX XXXX ET, I was at work and I couldnt pick up the phone. He left a voice message asking me to call him back. Five hours later, I received an email from SoFi informing me that my application has been denied because theyre Unable to verify my identity. I found this process to be very deceptive and unfair. I was already preapproved for the loan, they obtained my credit report, I uploaded LIVE photos of my drivers license and I was asked to provide my checking account information at another institution during application, this works as a second layer of protection because SoFi can cross-match the identity information of the checking account owner. Its worth noting that this loan was for {$5000.00}. I had 4 car loans in the past from 3 different banks, I never had an issue and none of them operates like SoFi. If you for any reason still want to verify customers identity, you could ask for photocopies of SSN, W2, or just wait for them to call you back.',\n",

SOFI contacted me over the next couple of weeks and collected all of the required documentation from me. My loan was in the final approval stage and was on the verge of being dispersed.

The woman also told me that they could expedite it, and it should go much quicker then the first time, and I had no need to worry, as everything was great on the loan and they could get it done. The next morning I did exactly what SOFI asked me to do, and I received an immediate denial due to \" inquiries on my credit report. \\'\\' The only inquiry that I had was the one for SOFI on the previous application.

However, I received an email at XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX stating Sofi was unable to offer me credit as I was previously approved. They offered terms at a higher interest rate with a monthly payment amount of {$1600.00}. Sofi 's reasoning to increase my interest rate was my income differed on my application. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Sofi to  discuss why my income had differed because I had inputted my correct income. I was informed my income was not the issue, but Sofi was unable to accept my co-signor. On this call I was told it was not their policy to accept a co-signor who is not a XXXX US XXXX. This information contradicted the previous information they provided and Sofi had been in receipt of  my co-signor 's XXXX information as of XX/XX/XXXX. However, as of XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX my  application was being accepted with my co-signor. It seems my interest rate was increased at the last hour in order to get my to pay a higher interest rate. I attempted to refinance my loan because I am currently in an adjustable rate and it continues to increase. I am beginning to struggle to make the payments and this will continue to worsen if my interest rate continues to increase.\",\n",

Nothing negative was reported on my credit. \\n\\nHowever, when I spoke to Sofi Lending Corp in XXXX of XXXX, they said they would allow me to skip 3 payments and it would be added on to the end of the loan. I spoke to a XXXX XXXX XXXX at Sofi (  email address : XXXX ). I received an email with a link to the secure message. The message has since been removed from the Sofi document center. But I have a copy of the email. Everything was agreed to verbally ( as was with XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX, all of them were extremely accommodating during the medical crisis ) I skipped the first payment as instructed and then I was receiving past due phone calls. Each time I spoke to them, they said their system wasn't updated as I explained the agreement. Each time they said they updated my file to show the deferment. But they kept calling for the next few months and I as adamant that my credit not be affected. They assured me it would not. I started making regular monthly payments in XXXX of XXXX and made the monthly payment on time each and every month. However, when I applied for an auto loan in XXXX, my credit score was greatly decreased due to multiple missed payments on my Sofi account. I contacted Sofi MULTIPLE times and they keep telling me all they show is the account was consistently past due. THIS IS INCORRECT. I contacted the credit bureaus, all 3, they said Sofi is claiming the information is correct. \\nI need to have my credit information updated to show that NO PAYMENTS WERE EVER PAST DUE TO SOFI LENDING CORP .\",\n",

The information given was that if automatic payments were established, there would be a recurring automatic rate reduction of .25 % that would lower the rate to the lowest available rate of around 5.9 % over time. For example, if the loan were 12 % then after one year of automatic payments the rate would reflect 9 %. After approximately 2 years, the rate would be about 6 %. I was told that the rate would drop with auto pay, the representative explained how SoFi was the only company that he knew of with this type of rate reduction program and that the original rate would show on the contract, however the rate would decrease with automatic payments, and that I could locate this unique program information on the company website. I trusted this person only to find out after speaking with a manager XXXX, that the information was false and that nothing could be done other than an apology, a \" coaching \\'\\' to the representative who\\'s name I believe is XXXX, and a small gift card as an \" olive branch \\'\\' for the misrepresentation.

I have this over 12 emails - where  customer service employees told me this was the right amount. I was then given paperwork to fill out for a monthly loan of {$700.00} at a rate of 5.25 % post auto-pay discount. I was told by 3 employees - over the phone and over email that this monthly rate would go down to {$650.00} per month. \\n\\nWhen I was then approved for the loan, I went ahead and filled out an application for an apartment where I was under the assumption I had {$50.00} extra to use for my utility bill.

I was then told by multiple employees that \" this was an internal bug \\'\\' that has since been fixed but I should go ahead and sign. To be honest, this feels like the definition of a bait and switch where I am being scammed into a price that I did not initially agree to, and was told would be a lower amount. I have tried to have conversations with them and they seem to not have any interest in reaching out. Is there anyway you can help?',\n",

I am not taking their loan and hope that filing a complaint here will shine a light on this company 's dishonest business practices so as to spare other borrowers from the same deceptive trap I fell into. Thank you!\",\n",

I was forwarded your email so I could reach out to you. \\n\\nI cant imagine what you must be dealing with right now.

It is the management policies of Sofi that are dishonest and why I want to pay off the loan I have with them with another vendor at a significantly lower rate.\\n\\nAt this point I am trying to pay off my loan with another vendor and that vendor tells me Sofi does not want to participate. It is my perspective that Sofi is a predatory and against the standards of the Consumer Protections Financial Board. \\n\\nCFPB should validate their controls and how they work with individuals with difficult circumstances which would validate the ethics and authenticity of this company. \\n\\nThanks',\n",

However, somehow the application fell through the cracks at SOFI. The application was never expedited as promised and was closed. For three weeks, I have been trying to speak with a manager to find our how we can re-open the application and for some reason SOFI keeps dodging me on speaking with a manager. I have called numerous times and sent numerous emails. Sofi keeps saying the manager has been unable to reach me but what they are doing is calling once and hanging up immediately. At this point, I am starting to see the light. This is all part of a harassment tactic of theirs to stop me from pursuing my case. I want to report them for harassment and unfair business practices. Also, their process is not streamlined and hence the need for the expediting process but this is a long story and far less important in comparison to the harassment I have been receiving by them. Desired Outcome : To have a manager phone me and not hang up and to re-open our original application at the original contracted interest rate. I do not want to start a new application at the higher interest rate ( interest rates have climbed and is now 1 % higher than the original application date interest rate )\",\n",

I logged into my XXXX XXXX and found a {$75000.00} loan from SoFi reporting on my credit. This loan was opened in my name and address using fraudulent contact information including a unregistered phone number and an old inactive email ( that I presume was used to communicate with the company ). \\n\\nI immediately placed a freeze on my credit report and, further, sent a letter to the company dated XX/XX/XXXX containing a copy of my FTC Identity Theft Report, proof of identity, dispute letter of the account in question and a notice of furnishers of information. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I received a \" fraud package \\'\\' mailing from Sofi requesting additional documentation in regards to my report. This called for a notorized affidavit, copy of government ID and a police report. \\n\\nI was able to submit all but the police report and sent the documents back to Sofi on XX/XX/XXXX.

They completely overlooked the fact that I had not even been in the country during the time the loan was initiated. \\n4 ) My request for additional information as to the origins of the loan from the company on XX/XX/XXXX has yet to be provided 8 days later, indicating to me that they did not do proper due-diligence when it came to their prior investigation.

All but the XXXX loan are currently serviced by XXXX. \\n\\nI recently have been working to get my credit score up so I could refinance the 4 private loans. My reasons for wanting to refinance are to get a lower interest rate and to remove my mother as a cosigner. I also add that when I was XXXX-XXXX, these private loan companies had no issue lending me this money. \\n\\nI have been reaping these private loans since XX/XX/XXXX and been making consistent payments ( never missed a payment to my knowledge ) other than the three years I was in XXXX school and they were deferred. The balance of the private loans is currently approx. $ 35k with a weighted interest rate of apron 8 %. If I am able to refinance at 6 %, my payment will decrease by over {$250.00} a month in just interest. \\n\\nI submitted a refinance application with Sofi. I submitted all requested information including my XXXX tax return and my XX/XX/XXXX P & Ls along with bank statements for verification. I am being told that my averaged income for the two years is $ XXXX, which I do not have a problem with that number based on the averages. \\n\\nMy issue is that they are telling me my income doesn't support a refinance and it is solely related to my income. I was told my payment history is fine and my credit score is fine. They can not lend to me solely based on my income. \\n\\nSo my main question/complaint is : How can they lend to me at XXXX-XXXX with no income and no credit history, but when I apply for a refinance at XXXX, making the most money I have ever made and the best credit history I have ever had, they don't see me as credit worthy for the loan? Oh, and might I add, the payment that I have been making consistently since XX/XX/XXXX ( minus XXXX school years ), will reduce by over {$250.00} per month with this refinance. So they do not have faith that I will make a {$250.00} less per month payment than I am currently making now. The only sense that makes to me is they are losing interest by reducing the interest rate and they have no benefit to approving this refinance. \\n\\nSo why not add a cosigner again you ask? well I tried that based on Sofi 's recommendation. To everyone 's surprise, she was denied? The same cosigner who was approved when I was XXXX-XXXX  with substantially the same credit score and income when I was XXXX-XXXX, is now all of a sudden denied when I am XXXX, making the most money of my career.\\n\\nHow can student loan companies loan money at high rates to XXXX-XXXX year olds trying to get an education and then refuse to refinance the same loans when those same students become adults and actually have income and credit?\\n\\nHow is this acceptable?\",\n",

Upon review, these closing fees were not as a result due to a change in circumstance, and the company representative responded that the fees were added into the closing disclosure because they inadvertently omitted them from the last disclosure document.

I recently learned SOFI called my property insurance company, XXXX, in XX/XX/XXXX and  requested they change the Mortgage Company to SOFI and  to send the bills directly to me. Due to this error by SOFI, I just received a notice of cancellation from XXXX. My current mortgage company is XXXX XXXX XXXX and I pay escrow for taxes and insurance. XXXX stopped billing XXXX due to SOFI 's request. XXXX has been using a 3rd party showing my insurance was past due and has been paying it monthly but they have been paying late. Therefore, XXXX sent a notice of cancellation. I also learned that SOFI requested an expedited payoff demand from XXXX and I was charged {$30.00} for the request which was refunded to me by XXXX after I explained what happened. I am complaining to the CFPB because SOFI 's actions do not seem right. I also find it hard to accept that XXXX would make such a change without my knowledge. I do not believe SOFI followed current TRID rules as I understand them.\",\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': \"Some background : I graduated in XXXX XXXX and 6 months after, in XXXX XXXX, I was expected to start repaying my loans. In attached documents you will see the principal amount, interest rate, and monthly payment amount. The job market has been tough, so I have been working several part time jobs, XXXX XXXX to make ends meet and have been trying to find salaried work for about a year and half. No luck, so I plan to obtain a XXXX certificate and become a XXXX in the coming year to two years. \\n\\nSince I have been expected to start making monthly payments, I think I have been able to make a total of 4 or 5 payments. SoFi has worked with a little bit, they granted me two 3 month long Economic Hardship Forbearances and these have helped immensely. However, there is a limit to how many of these you can be granted throughout the lifetime of the loan. ( As a side note, none of the representatives I ever talked to informed me the there was a limit on the amount months you could be in Economic Hardship Forbearance. Luckily, I read this in the fine print randomly on their website. ) I have used 6 of the 12 months allotted for my loan lifetime and am weary of using the other 6 when the lifetime of the loan is so long. I ca n't guarantee that I wo n't be in a similar financial hardship in the next 20 years, so you can understand why I want to avoid burning through this forbearance allowance in the first year. \\n\\nFor XXXX XXXX, I have been unable to make the monthly payment. I was doing fine until we hit the slow season at work ( XXXX XXXX during the holidays is hit or miss, for my job unfortunately it has turned out to be a huge miss ). So I called SoFi today  ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX ) to inquire about ways to lower my monthly payment. They forwarded me to XXXX, the company that works with them to process all payments. I spoke to XXXX who said my only options are to either 1 ) refinance or 2 ) apply for an economic hardship forbearance ( the  forbearance I described above ). I explained to him that neither of those options are reasonable because one, refinancing requires a hard inquiry on your credit ( which isnt worth doing when nothing drastic about my financial status has changed since the original financing of the loan ) and two, for the reasons mentioned above, I do n't want to use more months of the economic hardship forbearance. \\n\\nI then inquired about an income driven repayment plan to help adjust my payments to the income I 'm making. He reminded me these types of plans are only for federal loans, not private ones and basically said, sorry, youre out of luck. He told me to have a good evening and the phone call ended. This conversation unfortunately mirrored past conversations with SoFiXXXX where I left feeling hopeless and even more stressed out about the looming monthly bill.\",\n",

After entering in all of the qualifying questions and criteria we were presented a rate of approximately 2 percent and told that this rate would be held for 30 days, pending a complete application. On XX/XX/2019, I logged on to finish the application by uploading various co-signer documents. Once these documents were uploaded, we were then offered a rate of 4.19 percent, over doubling the amount offered during pre-qualification. On XX/XX/2019, I called the Sofi student loan department to see what the cause of this large increase was and I was told that it was due to \" income verification \\'\\' ; however, the income stated during qualification did not change when I uploaded the verifying documents. In addition, we did not have any additional debt that would cause our DTI ratio to increase. This practice seems deceptive as they make you go through the whole process before describing your actual rate, which is significantly higher than the rate they initially disclose. In addition, the representative made it seem like our age played a factor in the decision to increase the wage.',\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': \"I have been struggling to pay my private student loan bill and had to file a series of forbearances in order to not have my account be late/default on my loan. I called about 2 weeks ago and spoke to a customer service manager that an option for me to lower my payment would be to refinance the loan with SOFI, which would lower my interest and therefore lower my monthly payment amount. \\n\\nI applied for a refinance while I was waiting for a forbearance application to be reviewed and approved. The amount I was quoted with the refinance application was under {$700.00}, which would allow me to make my full monthly payment and not have to apply for forbearances. \\n\\nHowever, the application was 'stalled ' because when I connected my XXXX account to my Sofi application, an communication error between XXXX and SOfi occurred. on XX/XX/XXXX, I called SOFI and was told to call XXXX and ask that they updated their files. I debated why I should have to call XXXX when the issue was between Sofi and XXXX - I had provided all documentation and information requested of me. In the interest of time, I tried to submit the student loan documentation they were requesting manually, but it would not upload to my application. I therefore emailed SOFI directly with the information/documentation. A few hours later, I received a denial of my application - even though I was 1. told to apply, 2. pre-approved, and 3. have a very high credit score, good income, and no delinquencies on my credit report. \\n\\nIn follow up emails, SOFI explained the reason was because I had not provided documentation of my income and that I had I had a bad internal credit score with SOFI due to my use of forbearances. I had provided documentation of my income, and I'm receiving a 3 % raise in XX/XX/XXXX. Also, these forbearances were approved by SOFI and I was never told that use of necessary forbearances would impact my ability to refinance in the future. Nor was this mentioned as a potential barrier when I was told to apply for a refinance of my loans. \\n\\nI'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. I'm trying to do what is responsible and necessary in order to not go into default with my private student loans. I asked for guidance on what to do to lower my payment and was told to refinance by SOFI, was preapproved, and provided all necessary documentation/information for my application. By denying my application, SOFI has essentially removed the only mechanism I have to lower my monthly payment amount. This is not being customer friendly or helpful to someone with a high student loan debt burden. SOFI is forcing me to go into default with my student loans. \\n\\nI DO NOT HAVE A CO-SIGNER nor a potential Co-signer, so do not offer this as a suggestion. I should not need a co-signer with a nearly 800 credit score making over {$80000.00} ; I was able to take out a mortgage for double the amount of what I owe in private student loans on my own, without a co-signer, when I had less income and a lower credit score.\",\n",

I had another card ( discover card ) that the XXXX XXXX was ending in XX/XX/XXXX, and I wasnt able to fully pay it off before the end date of the promotion ( new card ). \\n\\nI tried to do the balance transfer through the app, but it didnt go through several times. Eventually, I ended up calling in, and a representative did it for me over the phone. I went over the promotion with her and verified that I would get a year of XXXX XXXX apr from XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX. She confirmed it before executing the transaction. Furthermore, she even recommended not using the card for any other transactions, to keep the promotion active. \\n\\nIn early XX/XX/XXXX, I received a finance charge of {$71.00}. I called in to find out why, and the rep told me that the interest kicked in. This didnt make any sense to me, because I didnt do a balance transfer and pay XXXX XXXX on the balance, only to be charged XXXX months later for interest. I had other cards I couldve used, but chose this XXXX - and this happened. I complained and asked them to file a work case. \\n\\nI called in a week later to find out about it, and the rep told me it was still in progress. I called twice in XXXX and was told the same thing. I just called XXXX minutes ago, only to be told that the case was closed XX/XX/XXXX- not in my favor. What happened to when I called in XXXX? And those XXXX reps I spoke to didnt record the fact that I called ( maybe because they were rude to me ). \\n\\nI truly believe the offer changed because I read it and went back to it for around XXXX weeks before I pulled the trigger. Even If I were wrong, their product advertisement was misleading and the initial rep did misrepresent the offer. I wouldnt have done the balance transfer, if I had known. The rep I just got off the phone with assured me theres nothing that he could do. Prior to this transaction, I didnt use the card for months. I didnt move {$5300.00} and pay XXXX XXXX  of that to only get charged more interest than the Discover card. I regret doing that because of this experience. Is there any recourse here?',\n",

Meaning, the cardholder shall be given credit during the investigation as determined by VISA Rules Section 1.1.11.1. \\n\\nhowever, the rules also state that the Cardholder must attempt to resolve a dispute with the Merchant or Merchants liquidator, if applicable. You provided copies of your email communications with the Merchant which confirm that the Merchant attempted to work with you to resolve the issue but you did not respond and therefore did not accept their assistance. - You say that I never responded to the merchant, this is false as I reviewed the emails myself and show my responses advising that I wanted a refund and would accept nothing less and even offered to take a 50 % refund. The Merchant refused! \\n\\nSoFi has not provided a provisional credit for the following reasons : -It is not required by Reg E - This is not a Reg E claim ; I provided you a call recording with VISA Rules Customer Service who clearly stated that this claim falls under VISA \" Consumer Dispute \\'\\' Rules and not under Reg E ; I also called the Fed Resv and CFPB and was advised of the same. Reg E only covers \" Errors \\'\\' on an account ; these pertain to ATM/Debit Card transactions using the PIN associated, it does not provide \" Consumer Dispute \\'\\' guidance.\\n\\nYou agreed to ( and did not honor ) a 15 day Money Back Guarantee with the Merchant - Under VCR 13.3 the Merchants refund policy has no bearing on the dispute and is not used to determine if the claim is valid or invalid. \\n\\nYou did not work with the merchant to resolve the issue. - This is not true I attempted twice to get the Merchant to view it from my standpoint and even offered to settle for less than the purchase amount. \\n\\nYou people apparently do not know the difference between a Reg E complaint and a \" Consumer Dispute \\'\\' and what guidelines to follow. You really need to sign up for VISA Class and get certified on how to handle these complaints. Considering if you simple review documents on the VISA website as well as companies who specialize in chargebacks you will see that I am 100 % correct and you are 100 % incorrect with this matter. \\n\\nI think that the Fed Resv, CFPB and VISA all need to be brought into this and give their take on this case and prove who is wrong and who is right.

SoFi 's system does not show that I have a loan through SoFi, and customer service has refused to help me locate my loan. \\n2 ) SoFi was misleading about its school deferment policy at the time I applied for a student loan, and the actual policy is unreasonable. \\n3 ) SoFi 's Customer Service has no idea what its own terms are. When I called in and spoke to a Supervisor on the Customer Service line, I was given information that is blatantly false - that SoFi has NEVER offered student loan ( only student loan refinancing ) and that SoFi has no in-school deferment policy. \\n\\nWhen I applied through SoFi, I was informed that I could defer student loans if I returned to school. I tried to contact SoFi when I started XXXX school this XXXX. I was told to work through SoFi 's student loan servicer XXXX. The first SoFi/XXXX customer service representative said that it would be taken care of, but that, contrary to my prior understanding, I was still responsible for making monthly interest payments. Since my other loan provider ( for another student loan ) had taken care of this without my input, I had no reason to doubt this. When I noticed that my account was still being auto-debited for the full amount, I called in and was told that I had to submit a formal loan deferment application, which was not mentioned during my first call. After I submitted the application, it took three months to process. The deferment took effect after it finished processing and only applies for 3 months, from XXXX to XXXX of XXXX. This makes no sense. I have been in school and in contact with SoFi and XXXX since end of XXXX XXXX. Since the current deferment only applies to XXXX to XXXX, I have been billed full payments during months when I should only have been paying interest. Since a normal XXXX semester runs from XXXX to XXXX, I now have to go through this entire process again, 3-4 months ahead of time, in order to have my interest deferred for an additional month. I spoke to someone at XXXX, the loan servicer, and was told that this was SoFi 's policy and that I should speak to them to see if they could make any changes. \\n\\nWhen I called SoFi 's customer service line, I was told a number of things that are not true. First, I was told that I do not have a student loan through SoFi. I was told that their system shows no active student loans and only XXXX subsequent loan refinancing applications ( which were rejected ). When I escalated the issue to a Supervisor, I was told that SoFi does not provide any kind of in-school deferment and that SoFi has never provided student loans. At this point, I asked the supervisor how long he had been working with the company and he admitted that he had not started working for the company until some time after XXXX, which was when I received my student loan from SoFi. \\nI asked the Supervisor if he could further escalate my case, but he said that he was the top of the chain. I asked if there was any way he could look into the matter, since I am certain that I do have a loan with SoFi and their records are incorrect. He said I could send documents to the general customer service line and they might open an investigation. I spent over an hour and a half speaking with SoFi 's customer service, and I am extremely frustrated that I am being forced to jump through so many hoops just to confirm that my loan, which I have been making payments on for 3 years, actually exists. I can not make any modifications to the loan repayment schedule, such as the in-school deferment period, because XXXX tells me that only SoFi has that authority, and SoFi refuses to acknowledge that I even have a loan with them. Please help.\",\n",

Because it is missing crucial information, it is not cashable by my bank ( XXXX XXXX ). This is the second check they sent me. The first they refused payment, this second does not meet the basic requirements of a legal ( cashable ) check. \\nResponse to last complaint resulted in a written lecture about the status of my phone and a promise to send a second check. Again, the second check does not meet the minimum standards of a cashable check as it is missing routing and account numbers- so my bank unable to submit for payment. \\nCalls to SoFi result in them taking my name, telling me call must be handled by regulatory complaints team, who will call me back, but then never actually calls me back. ( which I can prove by my phone 's call history ). They will claim this is because my phone has been hacked, but I had reset by my carrier back to factory settings and have had no issues outside of those with SoFi. \\nAs a bank, SoFi should be able to produce a check that is cashable. Telling the CFPB that they are sending me a check to close out this matter, but then refusing payment on the first check and sending a worthless check the second time, feels very much like an attempt to wear me down and not respond in a truthful way to this situation.\",\n",

I am attaching the statement showing that it is a new account, with a different account number than my old account. It shows the opening deposit of {$25.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and subsequent deposits. I'm also attaching a screenshot showing all transactions including direct deposit. \\n\\n\\nThe tems from the promotion when I applied were : The following describes the terms that apply to participation in the SoFi the SoFi Checking and Savings direct deposit program ( Program ) offered by SoFi Bank, XXXX Member FDIC ( SoFi ). Eligible Participants : All new members who open a SoFi Checking and Savings account during the Promotion Period and all existing SoFi Checkings and Savings customers who have not previously set up Direct Deposit transactions ( Direct Deposit ) into their SoFi Checking and Savings account as of the beginning of the Promotion Period are eligible for the Program. Promotion Period : The Program will be available from XX/XX/XXXX XXXX ET to XX/XX/XXXX XXXX ET. Bonus Terms : In order to qualify for eligibility for a bonus, SoFi must receive at least one Qualifying Direct Deposit from an Eligible Participant during the Promotion Period. Qualifying Direct Deposits are defined as deposits from enrolled members employer, payroll, or benefits provider via ACH deposit. Deposits that are not from an employer ( such as check deposits ; P2P transfers such as from XXXX or XXXX, etc. ; merchant transactions such as from XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, etc. ; and bank ACH transfers not from employers ) do not qualify for this promotion. The amount of the bonus, if any, is described below. No bonuses shall be paid for qualifying Direct Deposits of less than {$1000.00} during the Evaluation Period ( defined below ). Evaluation Period : The bonus amount will vary based on the total amount of Qualifying Direct Deposits received during the Evaluation Period. The Evaluation Period is defined as 30 days from the date your first Qualifying Direct Deposit is received. For example, if you receive $ XXXX {$1900.00} in Qualifying Direct Deposits in the Evaluation Period, you will receive a cash bonus of {$50.00}. A member may only qualify for one bonus tier and will not be eligible for future bonus payments if inflows subsequently increase beyond the Evaluation Period. \\n\\n\\nI am aware that the bonus SUBSEQUENT to my account opening changed to exclude former money account owners, but at the time of my account opening that was in the terms. I will include the screenshots. I would appreciate SoFi paying the {$300.00} bonus that they targeted me for and for which I have met the terns.\",\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'Sofi credit card had a promo around XX/XX/XXXX of offering a 5 % cashback for the first 12 months with a qualifying direct deposit of {$1000.00} per month. Then around the next month, they claim they made a mistake for 5 % but it should have been for 3 % cashback, which is fine for me. I can understand and accept that. I was earning 3 % until XX/XX/XXXX ( therefore I was only earning for around 2 months only ). The 3 % started becoming 2 % cashback and I spoke with phone reps 2 times to dispute this and once on online chat. I was still qualified since I met the {$1000.00} per month in direct deposit. I was also told that they would investigate the situation and see what went wrong. Today is XX/XX/XXXX. I have yet to hear a response back so I decided to message them on chat. The chat rep said that I hit the cap of XXXX points for the 3 % promo. I do not recall any maximum cap for XXXX points. I was not given any terms of conditions that stated that I had a cap of XXXX points. As I ask the chat rep to provide the terms of condition for further proof, the chat rep stopped answering me. Screenshot will be provided of the chat log. I think that Sofi is abusing their system and not following their own protocols. I wanted to report this for further investigation as Sofi is abusing their internal system.',\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'I did an on-line chat to get the address to send my payoff amounts for my XXXX loans. My normal address is a po box that you can not overnight payments. I sent in the payment to that address via fed ex with a tracking number. When the loans did not payoff timely, I called in to status. The customer service agent told me that they would forward to the proper address via regular mail and could take another week. I am confused why they would internally send payoff funds via regular mail to another one of their offices. After calling in 2 additional times, they finally told me to stop pay and reissue which I did. I asked to have the payments post dated to not pay any additional interest due to the error of the on-line rep. They did indicate this was an old address for them as I did not make it up. Now, they have asked proof of the on-line chat that they do not have stored in their system. I tried to log on to find it but they do not save the history for customers. I am at a loss as to how I can \" Prove \\'\\' this conversation to them when they do not keep these records. They have told me that they will not back date and I also had to make payments on both loans that they are now sitting on because of the time delay so I would not be reflected as being late. I just want to be refunded the interest due to their error and do not understand why this is so hard and I have to prove to them the on-line conversation. They also need to strengthen their handling of payoff funds.',\n",

Recently SoFi has been pushing for me to set automatic payments via emails and notifications when I log into my online account. They also advertised a reduced interest rate for setting up automatic payments. Once the payment for XXXX/XXXX/XXXX cleared my checking account and my account with SoFi online reflected next payment due on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I set up the automatic payments. Upon completing the steps for automatic payments a screen came up verifying that I would like to start auto payments effective for payment due XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I verified that was correct and was then under the impression that my next payment would be auto drafted from my checking account with XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. SoFi then without my authorization deducted a payment of XXXX} on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX from my checking account with XXXX XXXX XXXX. This unauthorized deduction caused an overdraft of my checking account. My account does have overdraft protection but I was penalized a XXXX fee and I also had to stop another check that was out for that account. At no point did I authorize SoFi to deduct any form of payment from my account prior to XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. At no point did SoFi disclose that they would make such a deduction. I contacted SoFi customer service to resolve the issue twice. Each time I was told a different story as to what happened and no fair resolution was offered. I had asked politely to speak to a manager but was informed there was none available and they would call me back. No contact has been made on their end to date.',\n",

After a few days I received an email stating they needed my most recent paystubs, which I submitted shortly after. Then I received another email / text asking for additional information. \\nI called and spoke with the customer service representative over the phone and she states that the underwriter needed clarification about a loan I took out with Sofi and paid off within 1 month ( I told her I had the funds and instead of paying high interest rate I decided to pay the loan off ). \\nA few days later the underwriter XXXX called and I called him back and he asked the same question. Again I advised him that \" I paid off for the loan within the month because I had the extra money to do so \\'\\'. \\n\\nWithin 1-2 days I received a credit decision stating my application was declined. I called in a spoke with a few different customer services reps and an escalation specialist who all told me the reason for the decline was due to me paying off my loan within a month and that the company policy if that I have to make 3 consecutive payments before paying off the loan ( this was never stated in the original contract ) and because I did not meet the 3 consecutive payments and paid the loan off within a month they would not be able to approve the loan. \\n\\nI think this is very unfair to deny my application for paying off the loan within 30 days I met all the lender other qualification I.E. XXXX and Credit score requirement and would like to know how a company can make such decisions.',\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': \"On XXXX I applied for a credit card consolidation loan. ( XXXX XXXX ) This was approved on that date. This loan amount was {$80000.00}. As a part of this process, I took advantage of a favorable interest rate reduction of .25 % by supplying the account numbers for each credit card that was to paid off. This included the credit card number, and card verification code. This was validate real-time by SoFi 's XXXX as shown by an error for one card I'd entered that it claimed was under a different name. ( This error was erroneous, as I believe they included my middle initial for that card. ) Later that day ( XXXX ) I noted that a disbursement of {$12000.00} was made to one of my cards at XXXX, and {$300.00} was deposited to my checking account which is also at XXXX. However, there was a third account at XXXX that did not receive a distribution. I checked the other accounts at other institutions ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Bank XXXX XXXX ) to see if they'd received any distributions. They had not. Each subsequent day I continued to log in to each of those financial institutions ' online banking sites to check on the status of a payment. There were none from SoFi. \\n\\nI contacted XXXX on XXXX to alert them to what I believed to be a problem. They refused to assist further as it hadn't been 3 business days since the distribution. I pressed them for transaction verification IDs for the XXXX. Either the agent did not have this information, or she refused to provide it to me. I said I'd wait until the 3 business days were met. \\n\\nI called again on XXXX as there were still no distributions to the other financial institutions. As I spoke to the agent, he agreed to open a request to check on the disbursement of the funds. He noted that it will take 24 to 48 hours to complete the investigation, and that they would let me know. Meanwhile, I am still accruing interest on the accounts in question AND interest on the SoFi loan that started on XXXX. \\n\\nMy belief is that it should NEVER require a customer to point out a failed XXXX transfer. Customers do not have the information necessary to investigate failures. ( In particular, originating institution information and XXXX transaction IDs. ) Instead, SoFi should have the technology and processes in place to validate the successful transmissions and either re-transmit or work with the customer ( me in this case ) to correct any issues found. In this particular case, the apathy of the SoFi customer support team is benefiting SoFi ( they still have the funds ) and harming the consumer ( the consumer is now paying two interest accruals ).\",\n",

I got an email from XXXX XXXX stating that the bank statement did n't verify ( it was a joint account ). SO I gave them my other account with a small credit union XXXX. I got a letter signed from the people at the bank verifying that is was my account. 4 days later I got an email saying they could n't verify my identity and they denied me XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nNo one gave me a chance or ask me to provide anything more. I gave drivers license, birth certificate, social security and they ran my credit. \\n\\nI called and they could n't tell me anything as to why they could n't verify because it look good on their side. Then they told me to reapply. \\n\\nI thought this as strange as most companies do n't allow you keep applying. \\n\\nI applied again anyway to see. XX/XX/2015 I applied again. \\nXX/XX/XXXX. I signed the documents on XX/XX/XXXX. I got an email stating my loan was approved. I called and spoke to customer service several times and they all said keep checking my account the funds will be in there. Give it 3-4 days. 5 days later they said because I have a smaller credit union it may take sometime. I called yesterday and they said that is hould be in my account no later than XX/XX/2015. I checked the sofi today and it is saying my account is withdrawn. \\n\\nI am so confused I never withdrew the loan and I feel like it was all a game to give me the run around. When I normally am approved for something and they say funds with be in account that is usually the case. I am not sure if this is a legit company.

They said it was something that could n't be verified. If this is the case how did I sign loan and then they said it was not able to verify things.

In the application process I provided my requested information including my current annual income of {$120000.00}. They pre-approved me for a 5 year fixed loan for the amount requested at a rate of 3.99 %. I applied for the loan and provided requested pay stubs for income verification purposes. These paystubs from the end of XX/XX/XXXX showed year to date income of {$51000.00} which I used to calculate the annual income I submitted with my application of {$120000.00} scaled for 12 months. None of this income was bonus or commission type income and was all directly related to my profession and work as a XXXX XXXX. <P/>SoFi told me that they would not accept this income for verification purposes implying that a portion of my income would be treated like bonus or commission type income for which they ask 2 years of prior XXXX statements. Specifically, approximately {$40000.00} of my current annual income out of the {$120000.00} is regular XXXX reported taxable income ( not XXXX ) from picking up extra shifts at the XXXX ( not overtime and commonly referred to as \" moonlighting \\'\\' in the XXXX XXXX ). I do n\\'t believe a reasonable consumer would believe that this is bonus or commission type income, and there is no information available that would suggest this type of income would be treated differently for verification purposes in the application process ( SoFi does specifically mention bonus or commission type income on their website though ). <P/>SoFi then tells me that they would no longer be able to offer the rate of 3.99 %, but that the good news was that they were still able to conditionally approve me at a new 5 year fixed rate of 5.115 % ( 28 % higher than the 3.99 % rate they had pre-approved me at ). <P/>At that point I was thinking, oh well, SoFi as a private company can set whatever standards it wants for its lending as long as not discriminating or breaking other laws. But then I read other reports on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau website and found that many others reported similar experiences of being pre-approved at one low rate, and then experiencing some type of difficulty in the application/verification process outside of what a normal/reasonable consumer would expect and then being told of the good news of being offered a higher interest rate than the one they were pre-approved at. This higher interest rate is offered after the consumer has provided their protected financial information and authorized a hard credit check ( which hurts their credit ) and SoFi can then share/sell/use this financial information in a proprietary way while not honoring their marketed or pre-approved rates in good faith.',\n",

When I received an email specifically showing the range of rates I could qualify for, I submitted an application for their pre-approval process, which does not involve a credit check. The rate quoted was above my current interest rate, so on XX/XX/XXXX I called to inquire if the rate could go down before I formally applied. The associate I spoke too informed me that if I provided a statement showing my current balance and interest rate, Sofi would match or beat the rate, and that the pre-approval rate was not locked in. Knowing this, I applied later that day, and on XX/XX/XXXX returned a voicemail from the company stating that my loan was approved and I could electronically sign loan documents. \\n\\nThe associate I spoke to on this day informed me that the approved rate ( which again, was higher than my current rate ) could not be changed. I asked if there was any way to look into a lower rate, and she told me absolutely not. I asked her to withdraw my application. \\n\\nI called back on XX/XX/XXXX ( today ), because I realized that Sofi made an inquiry for my credit report, which would potentially negative affect my credit score. I am not happy that I was told that Sofi would be able to match or beat a rate after applying, and then after the inquiry was told they could not. The associate I spoke with told me she was sorry for any misunderstanding, and that I could re-apply and see if I could get a lower rate again, since my current application had been withdrawn at my request. \\n\\nAfter this call, I received a message through Sofi \\'s message center stating that I could re-apply and provide the Regulation Z TILA disclosure from any loans that I am currently \" shopping for \\'\\' and that they would consider matching that rate. \\n\\nI realize that the company can not \" reverse \\'\\' a credit inquiry, so there is very little they can do about this. However, I feel it should be reported, as I was strongly encouraged to apply to receive a better rate. I never would have authorized the credit inquiry had I known that my current rate could not be matched or beaten.',\n",

On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from SoFi for their rate match program. The advertising says that if I supply competitors documentation they would match that rate. I called SoFi on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX  to discuss the offer and was told that all I needed to do was to submit the documentation, pull my credit to determine eligibility and they can match the rate. I submitted XXXX XXXX  's offer and submitted the application. I received notification at XXXX XXXX  from SoFi that the application was complete and that I can sign the documents. After review the loan docs, I found that the rate was still 5.149 %, I called SoFi and told them of the mistake and the representative on the phone advised that they would go back to the underwriter of the mistake and I should receive new loan documents. At XXXX XXXX  I received notification again that the loan documents were complete. I checked the rate again and it was still the same 5.149 % rate. I called XXXX again this time the representative advised that they can't match the XXXX XXXX  's rate because the rate they offered is the lowest they can offer for the 15 year term. I said then why would XXXX send me an advertising to match a rate when they knew that they couldn't even go lower than what was offered?? I was transferred to a supervisor, his name is XXXX XXXX form the account specialist team and he explained that they recently changed their policy that they would not rate match if the rate is the lowest they can offer. I advised him that it was false advertising because they couldn't provide me a lower rate from the beginning. So why did they tell me to submit my application and re-pull my credit which has an adverse effect on my credit. He couldn't explain why. I told him that I checked the legal language and there is nothing that says that they will not offer a lower rate if it is the lowest they can provide. I have the email saved in my email box. The only thing he is able to offer is to submit a suppression of credit inquiry.\",\n",

I contacted them again and they once again informed me that they could not verify my income, which seems pretty odd given the fact that I have submitted multiple paystubs from my very reputable employer. \\nThey proceeded to inform me that there is nothing they can do to rectify the matter. \\nWhen I expressed my concern regarding the negative impact this can cause to my credit especially that it was a system failure on their end and that I/ my credit should not be held responsible for their verification process failure, they informed me that I should dispute this with the credit bureau XXXX XXXX  ''. \\nI contacted XXXX  and they informed me that they can not dispute a hard inquiry and advised me to contact CFPB and place a complaint with hopes of removing this wrongful inquiry from my credit report as I have no hand in the process failure.\",\n",

Looking at the payment history these 2 payments were credited to our account in error. So 2 payments in XXXX and 2 in XXXX. This equaled 4 payments instead of the 2 we made. This error was noticed in XXXX and 2 payments reversed. 4-2=2. However because correcting Sofis clerical error resulted in 2 reversals in XXXX it showed we did not make XXXX payment which in fact we did and it was received XX/XX/XXXX. So it showed we were delinquent and behind on payments even though we were not so then it kicked off the auto pay for XXXX. So Sofi tried saying we were late for both XXXX and XXXX. They have since sent harassing mail to help with mortgage payments and have called my employer when all of this directly reflects their clerical error. I brought it to their attention on XXXX and today is XX/XX/XXXX with no resolution in sight. I called XXXX, XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX spending over 2 hours on each phone call between wait time and talking with a representative. The representatives not only were rude but claim they did not see the miss accounting with 2 payments in XXXX, XXXX in XXXX and several said they saw the reversal but didnt know what happened and could put in a ticket to investigate it. No one can give me updates. They cant transfer me to anyone to follow up. No supervisor can call me back. They even sent me to collections department rather than acknowledging their error and fixing the situation to show I did make the XXXX payment. Since their error resulted in XXXX payment not being drafted we wanted to wait till XXXX was accurately posted to make the XXXX payment however in the mean time finally yesterday XX/XX/XXXX out of fear of my credit showing Im behind 2 months mortgage I made 2 more payments ( a second one for XXXX and my XXXX ). This now us making 4 payments for the year- 1 in XXXX, 2 in XXXX and 1 in XXXX. I did not want to make 4 payments to be credited for 3 months of payments.

According to the promissory note each payment would be in the amount of {$2000.00}. With auto pay that rate was reduced to 3.256 %, which I understand would serve to accelerate the number of payments, and not decrease the monthly payment amount. Since the loan funded I have had the following payments automatically withdrawn from my checking account : XX/XX/XXXX - {$2000.00} ; XX/XX/XXXX - {$2000.00} ; XX/XX/XXXX - {$2000.00} ; XX/XX/XXXX - XXXX. Notably 3 of these amounts are different, and all are above the {$2000.00} amount included in the promissory note. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I received correspondence from XXXX, the SoFi loan servicer, that my repayment schedule had changed. It reflected an interest rate of 4.006 % and a monthly payment of {$2000.00}. I contacted XXXX and although they could not confirm why I received that letter, they assured me my rate was 3.256 % I requested a copy of my promissory note, which was provided to me by XXXX. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, as I was reviewing my bank statments, I observed the above funds withdrawals and contacted SoFi. Initially I was told by SoFi that this concern needed to be addressed directly with XXXX. When I informed them that I had already tried, and reminded them that my agreement to repay the loan pursuant to the above terms was with SoFi, i was told they would address the issue. I forwarded to XXXX XXXX, of SoFI, attachments that evidence the promissory note sent to me by XXXX, export of bank statements evidencing the withdrawals, and correspondence from XXXX evidencing the 4.006 % I was told on XX/XX/XXXX that it may take 24-48 hours to get a response from XXXX.

As I currently hold some credit card debt, and need to replace the windows on my home, I chose to inquire to what I would qualify for on XX/XX/2018. I was immediately denied. In the denial letter SoFi recommended I visit their \" trusted partner \\'\\' XXXX. XXXX is \" able to approve some people that SoFi can not \\'\\'. I complained via email on XX/XX/XXXX, as I was denied for having \" obligations exceeding income \\'\\' ( with no explanation as to what that means ) and despite having a credit score over 800. The reply stated that the factors evaluated included credit history ( score over 800 ), level of education ( XXXX ), years of professional work experience ( 3+ ), and income ( over $ 50K ). I responded that their letter stated one reason, but their generic email reply stated it was a constellation of factors. I also complained as it appeared that they send pre-approval letters in order to send applicants to their \" trusted partner \\'\\' after denying them ( potentially making them more desperate ). My email was then forwarded to a customer service rep who responded on XX/XX/XXXX that she would like to schedule a meeting to discuss the denial. I replied that I was not interested in having a verbal conversation, and wanted their explanation in writing. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a reply from a different customer service rep indicating that they had written a \" clarification \\'\\' letter that contained \" additional details \\'\\', and that I would be removed from their mailing list. The letter states that I was declined for \" excessive obligations relative to income \\'\\' and \" other - does not offer credit terms requested \\'\\'. I responded with further questions - SoFi says they calculate my \" obligations \\'\\' based on averages ( not actual figures pertinent to my situation ), so I want to review what those numbers are. And what does \" does not offer credit terms requested \\'\\' meant as I had made no requests. I had requested no dollar amount, no APR - I was sent a pre-approval letter. I also requested that they delete the account I had to create as I do not want my account hacked and information stolen. The second customer service rep replied on XX/XX/XXXX that the calculated debt to income ratio would cause the possible interest rates to exceed what Arkansas restricts to. I don\\'t live in Arkansas. He was also unable to give clarification on what number was calculated as my average as it is \" proprietary company information \\'\\'. He did say my account would be deactivated, and I could visit their privacy policy webpage. I responded with the information that I do not in fact live in Arkansas, and that I would make a complaint concerning their business practices as they are opaque, and their goal continues to appear to be to drive would-be customers to a \" trusted partner \\'\\'.',\n",

I had another envelope containing a pin # for the credit card.

I have emailed them on separate occasions on XXXX, XXXX and XXXX to inquire about these two promotions, as well as two phone class to their support number. Today ( XXXX ) I received a email stating I would not get the 3 % because I did not go through a link on XXXX, although this link I used is publicly posted on many consumer websites, is still active, and goes directly to a sign-up at XXXX, so the bank is using it to recruit new account-holders, and apparently refusing to honor the 3 % or the XXXX. To their credit, they have posted XXXX to make up for not honoring the 3 %, but I still believe XXXX needs to honor the XXXX promotion.

When I called them the 2nd time at that point they apologised and asked me to provide with the code orals they won't be able to apply the promotion. Never have I faced a similar situation from a credit card company. I never retained the paper as its been nearly 4 months. I never anticipated something like this. They are plainly denying any responsibility and it's a clear case of cheating and manipulating for charging interests. It is such an unfair practice. I don't think I will continue with this card but I want solutions regarding the promotional offer being applied to my account.

In contacting XXXX Bank, the funds issuer, they told me my bank should be able to initiate a mobile deposit correction without any communication from them, but I could not make a correction with them because I am not the account owner at XXXX Bank. I talked to the account owner and they were able to initiate the correction, which happened on XX/XX/XXXX and was expected to complete within XXXX hours. The XXXX Bank account owner gave me a copy of the receipt for the adjustment. I contacted SoFi to follow up on XX/XX/XXXX since I had yet to receive an update and the representative told me they would get back with me if it had not been fixed by the end of the week. On XX/XX/XXXX I called SoFi because I had not received any updates. They told me they had not received the adjustment from XXXX Bank. I contacted XXXX Bank for status. They told me I could not get any information because I am not the account holder. I contacted SoFi again and they told me I could submit the receipt for their back office to process the transaction and they would contact me by COB XX/XX/XXXX, but I have received no additional information and neither bank seems to be able to make any progress with the other. The latest I got from SoFi was an email with the following : I did just get a response back from them. They are still pushing back stating the request has to come from XXXX Bank. They stated they will need the adjustment sent over by XXXX  again for the adjustment to take place. I would recommendcalling again with that referencenumber. You don't need any info on the account but to let them know SoFi has not received the request from them and it needs to be resent. So sorry for the hassle! \\n\\nThis is what I did earlier today and XXXX Bank would not tell me anything because I am not the account holder. There does not seem to be anything that either company is willing to do to progress this along.\",\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'SoFi heavily advertised a {$450.00} bonus paid in cash for refinancing a loan with them. The process of setting up the loan, while it does involve entering bank account information, does not trigger the payment of the {$450.00}. \\n\\nThere are no clear instructions on how to provide the needed information to SoFi to receive the {$450.00}. I received emails notifying me they needed my bank account info for ACH deposit, but the link took me to a general account home page with no clear place to input the information. \\n\\nAfter reaching out to their customer service, they told me it could be found in the \" refer a friend \\'\\' section of the \" membership \\'\\' menu. There was nothing before my interaction with the customer service agent that pointed this out or made it clear in any way on the website or in any emails. Additionally, the terminology on where the information is to be entered does not align with what a reasonable person would normally search for and creates UDAAP concerns on my part. \\n\\nI believe that the process is potentially designed to be deliberately difficult to reduce the number of customers who actually complete the needed information to receive the {$450.00}. I recommend an audit of the company \\'s incentive program, communication, and the number of claimed rewards vs those that are not. I would also recommend the analysis be performed from a Fair Lending perspective to determine if there has been a disparate impact on XXXX  customers.',\n",

I reach out to SoFi repeatedly over the past several months and they eventually decided to deny the bonus. They quoted their referral link terms which state : \" You will not receive multiple referral bonuses for the same friend taking out multiple loans or products, nor will your friend receive multiple welcome bonuses for taking out multiple loans or products. \\'\\' However, that is not the scenario under which I am requesting the referral bonus. Neither of us has taken out multiple loans.

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'Good day. I am writing to make a complaint about SoFi, a lending company based in XXXX XXXX, CA. This company has deceptive practices as well as does not follow the letter of the law with regards to offering financial services, qualifying a borrower and lending based off the provability of the borrower. \\n\\nMy journey started when I applied with SoFi for a {$25000.00} personal loan. My application was submitted approximately XXXX10 days ago. I completed and uploaded everything requested from this company. About XXXX7 days later, I called to inquire about the status of my application. At that time, I was told that \" no one had looked at it yet and it would be assigned right away. \\'\\' Based off the conversation I had with the representative, I did not feel comfortable. At this point, I saw on the site the CEO of the company lists to email him directly with any feedback about the process. I did just that and also listed out my experience in lending and asked, based off what they \" advertise \\'\\' that they look beyond a few factors I know that would come up. No it is not bad credit ( XXXX score ), it is not BK \\'s or foreclosures - it is the overuse of credit recently and inquiries. I knew this and reported it to the CEO himself. I was not concerned about my qualifications of the fact I have the availability to repay. \\n\\nAfter sending this email, someone was finally assigned to my loan. At first, the woman on the phone did not understand my bonus / commission income. I was asked to send my employment contract and that she would \" talk to a manger \\'\\' to see if they could do it. This morning, I got the call. \" XXXX XXXX, you are approved. We worked everything out with your income, we can use it. I just need you to email you XXXX and XXXX XXXX \\'s. \\'\\' They had everything else, they just needed to documentation. \\n\\nOnce I uploaded all I had, I received a call back from SoFi. This time XXXX was on the phone. XXXX said, \" XXXX XXXX, I am sorry but we are not able to give you a loan. I know we just told you that you are approved, however since we received your email we changed our minds. \\'\\' Basically, because I was real and transparent with the CEO, they decided to cancel my loan and say \" I do n\\'t qualify. \\'\\' When I said, \" I guess I should n\\'t have sent that email \\'\\' she proceeded to say, \" Yeah, you should n\\'t have. \\'\\' After this, I received the \" you are denied \\'\\' email and then I requested the adverse action. In that they list my excessive debt to income ratio. So I went from \" you should n\\'t have emailed the CEO to my debt to income is too high \\'\\' ALL this after I was told I was approved. \\n\\nAs you can see from my email attached, I was very transparent. They pulled my credit, it was a XXXX and my income based off the call I got this morning was \" acceptable and you are approved. \\'\\' I have been in XXXX 18yrs. I understand things happen. In this instance, there is nothing here for them to deny my loan. They basically are discriminating against me because I emailed the CEO. I do n\\'t want people to get hurt anymore. Shallow promises are not what our country is about. I am a veteran XXXX, I live by honor and commitment. This company has none of these XXXX. \\n\\nI have attached documents for your review. Please feel free to contact me for a personal interview if needed. \\n\\nI would also like to point out, based off the XXXX C \\'s of lending ( Credit, Collateral and Capacity to repay ), none of these are negative for them to deny my application for credit. They have shown me no proof of such and are in direct violation of the CFPB \\'s rules about discriminating against a consumer that qualifies for a loan.',\n",

I am not 100 % sure on which date but it would have been around XX/XX/XXXX. I was approved and they sent me paperwork to electronically sign on my new loan. I noticed that the amount was wrong so I contacted them to fix the problem. First I called them to clarify. I got sent the paperwork and it was still wrong. Then I contacted them via their online chat service. They asked me to provide them with my most recent student loan statements from XXXX. I did. They said they would fix it. I was very explicit that I was refinancing all XXXX  loans except for loan number XXXX. All other loans were to be refinanced including loans XXXX and XXXX. They sent me the paperwork to sign and it was wrong a third time. I then called them via telephone again and was asked to again submit my most recent XXXX statements. I sent them a second time. They sent me the paperwork again and the amount was correct so I signed it. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX they sent the funds to XXXX to refinance my student loans. However they made a huge mistake and sent all of the money to one of XXXXXXXX XXXX  departments and no money to the other department that contains loans XXXX and XXXX. Apparently XXXX has two separate departments. I contacted Sofi about the mistake on XX/XX/XXXX and was told to call XXXX and have them move the funds over to the two loans in the other department ( XXXX and XXXX ). When I called XXXX I was told that they could not move funds over to the other two loans because that is a separate department and they are unable to do that on their end. They told me that the money would have to be refunded then sent to the other department by myself or Sofi. I contacted Sofi and was told to have them refund the money to me so that I can pay the other two loans off. After A LOT of back and forth with XXXX  I have only been able to get about {$1800.00} refunded back to me, which I have already used to pay down one of the loans that was supposed to be refinanced. There is another {$4300.00} that XXXX has not refunded to me or Sofi that is supposed to go to payoff the rest of the balances on loans XXXX and XXXX. \\n\\nDuring this time I am being charged interest on these loans by both companies. Sofi issued my monthly payment for me last month and say that they can do this month as well but that is it. I expect them to refund the interest I am being charged on money that I didn't receive, especially after making the huge mistake they made. I have been in contact with one of Sofi 's representatives via email that is supposed to help solve this issue, yet she keeps asking me to make all the calls to XXXX and do all of the work to fix Sofi 's mistake. I have and can provide all of those emails if I need to.\",\n",

( as some of these were charges in other countries being made ) the rep that I spoke to said he would close that card and send me a new one and resolve the charges. I asked a number of questions as he couldnt give me any answer to or what outcome would be and just assured me it would be taken care of. Its been 60 days, I havent received a new card and I these charges are still appearing and Im being shown Im late on my payments and I cant get through to the company. Every time I call, I get a automated message that says thanks for calling sofi, were away from the phones right now. This is ruining my credit score and causing it to report over the limit. There are several XXXX dollars of XXXX charges that were never made by me so online items that say XXXX are there a few times. I dont know what else to do to get this resolved. I have tried calling every time, I have a spare minute when Im not working and I can never reach anyone through chat or by phone. I would like someone to reach out to me so this can get resolved.

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'Hi, I am trapped in a loan with SoFi that I did not ever sign up for. I got tricked apparently by a set of steps check your rate, collect diamonds. And I completed enough steps to finish the loan, so they say. They had a snooze option, which would keep the loan from funding until XXXX expired. They funded the loan early. I apparently did not cancel in time. They didnt send the disclosures until 5 months after I allegedly agreed to the loan. I am a public university employee and getting trapped in this loan will cost me an extra {$43000.00} and 5 years. SoFi represents itself as my bank, but is really hard selling me any kind of loan they can through an App. I dont think I ever signed up for this loan, and regardless, SoFi holds itself out as my bank and is rewarding me with cash bonuses and incremental small bonuses to progress through the application process, not disclosing material facts in a timely manner, and now refusing to return my loan to federal, even though I asked before XX/XX/XXXX when it funded. I had tried emailing and calling even earlier to cancel, but they only communicate over Chat. And robot chat. I am hoping someone can help me. Simply by following steps in an app I turned a XXXX loan into a XXXX loan with a 6 % interest rate. I dont even know how it happened, and now I am in a Terrible position. I write because I need help and I also think it would be terrible if SoFi got a bank charter and could harm more people. Can you help me follow up with SoFi or direct my complaint to the appropriate agency? \\n\\n\\nOn Wed, XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX PM XXXX XXXX XXXX wrote : Hi XXXX, I never agreed to this loan. \\n\\nThe awarding of diamonds as people upload documents, the snooze feature and the early trigger of loan funding is inherently predatory. Potential borrowers should receive robust disclosure. Not subjected to a gameification scheme by which people are lulled into loans. More concerning, is that you would even elect to enroll someone in a loan that will cost them {$43000.00} extra. That is Inherently predatory. Also unkind and disrespectful. Not actions of a company wanting to gain a bank charter. The communication with SoFi has also been difficult and void of any humanity. SoFi conned me into this loan likely because of my low vision status and the snooze feature expiring too early. Also, Your failure to provide prominent disclosures about the attributes of this loan is also troubling and what I would call overly cagey, probably predatory. The fact that policy changed dramatically re : PSLF while we were snoozed and you didnt change any disclosures or require updated signatures is also very cynical. SoFis scamming me into this loan is morally reprehensible and I hope you will connect me with a manager before I proceed to take further action. \\n\\nI also find the complete lack of desire to act in best interests of your customer throughout this process to be concerning. Please connect me with someone. \\n\\nBest, XXXX XXXX Tue, XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX PM XXXX wrote : Hello XXXX, Thank you for reaching out to SoFi in regards to your Student Loan Refinance application that was in snooze status until XXXX when the loan funded. \\n\\nIt is never our intention to mislead or force anyone to complete the application process if they don\\'t want to.

After providing all my personally identifiable information to their system, I was told they would reach out if they needed anything additionally. \\n\\nThe next morning I received a rejection letter citing \" UNABLE TO VERIFY INCOME \\'\\' as the reason. I immediately called SoFi \\'s toll free number XXXX and the customer service rep said that it was because I had a credit lock on my account and I could apply again tomorrow if I removed it. I notified the rep that we had no such lock and she continued to reiterate applying again. I asked to speak with a supervisor and was informed that someone would call me back because they were all busy at the moment. \\n\\nAfter not receiving the call back as promised, on XX/XX/XXXX I reached out again to the toll free number and went through almost the same explanation. I then again asked to speak with a supervisor and this time I was connected to XXXX. I detailed my trouble and explained that maybe the system had a problem with my application due to an outage or something because I had provided everything their system had asked for and maybe he could review it for me by a human. He stated that even though we provided paper copies of my last paycheck and the W2 from the employer from the latest year, they couldn\\'t approve the application because their \" PROPRIETARY \\'\\' system of income verification couldn\\'t verify my pay. When I asked if they reached out to my HR department to verify employment or asked the IRS a form XXXX for digital verification he stated no, we don\\'t do that and again reiterated the PROPRIETARY system they have used. XXXX also stated that there was no recourse because they will not disclose how they verify income thus preventing me from remedying the problem with my bank or HR or whoever else they contact to validate my income. \\n\\nDue to the attempt to resolve the issue directly with a person in authority with SoFi and their inability to legitimately provide reason for rejection, I feel this company is engaged in fraudulent loan practices or is profiting from selling sensitive data to 3rd parties or something like that. My credit is impeccable, credit score of XXXX, stable job for 10 years, current on taxes, homeowner, etc, etc, etc. So the PROPRIETARY system they are using to verify income is either a bogus excuse or the company never intended to extend credit in the first place. In other words, Fraudulent! \\n\\nUpon request I can upload the SoFi rejection letter as well as the documents I uploaded to prove income. ALL of these document are most current including the last pay period as well as most current year W2. I can also provide sworn and notarized statement from my bank of 30 years and my employer of XXXX that no one reached out to verify income. \\n\\nIn closing, I am truly aghast that SoFi is unable to hand process and verify someone\\'s loan. Had I known that only robots ran this company, I never would have applied there. Now my personally identifiable/sensitive information ( which must be kept for 25 months they informed me ) is in the hands of this inept company. Now I must worry that I\\'ll be the victim of a hack one day because they released all my info to some third party or something and made a quick buck off me. This is not right! \\n\\nBest regards, XXXX',\n",

Since then, every employee has given me a different story on when the funds will be in my account. I 've been told on three different occasions the funds were ACH 'd into my account and would be available in a few business days. I was given other deadlines by two additional employees for when the funds would be available and those, too, have came and passed. The customer service representatives have no more information available to them than I do when viewing my application online, and I 'm being told that the fate of these funds is in the hands of a funding department that no one can contact, has access to, or has a phone number for. A supervisor was supposed to get me a transaction tracking number and call me back, she never did. I spoke with another supervisor who told me the funds were approved XXXX XXXX, and I have yet to see them. At this point I think I was the victim of a fraudulent scam aimed to obtain personally identifiable information from consumers. The interest rate on my acceptance paperwork is actually higher than what I was approved for, and that paperwork says I have a payment due on XXXX XXXX, even though I never received a dollar from this company. At the very least, this is an inefficient, misleading, and dishonest company who flat out lies to consumers. Worst case scenario, it 's a complete scam.\",\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'Upon opening up this account with Sofi, it was advertised and opened as an account that would allow you to overdraft up to {$50.00} if you qualify. The qualifications were you would need to have at least {$1000.00} in direct deposits monthly. They also had a promotion that ran concurrent with the overdraft protection but for direct deposit itself. If you set up direct deposit you would get {$100.00} as a welcome bonus. You would need {$1000.00} in qualifying direct deposits in order to qualify for the {$100.00}. On XX/XX/2021 I received my {$100.00} welcome bonus. Hence, that means I must have had qualifying direct deposits, as I had. However, I never ever til this day was able to use my overdraft. I relied on it, despite never using it, but being that I had qualified month after month, at one point I put my trust in Sofi to see the logic of why I should qualify for overdraft and provide this feature that they offered and I established this account to use. I was told by a manager that my direct deposits are being coded as deposits. Due to this misnomer, no fault of my own, they never gave me access. I emailed, I went on social media, I spoke with various departments. I was told to wait like 2 weeks and then once I qualify with the {$1000.00} deposits again, it would work. I subsequently moved my deposits elsewhere since I need overdraft at time, and after months of qualifying and even getting a bonus paid out due to direct deposits being received, it is infuriating that they did nothing despite my numerous complaints to provide me the benefit they dangled to cause me to get the account. I have since been told that I would just need to qualify again with the deposits in order to get the overdraft, which they fixed now for my account I guess. But I had been inquiring since XX/XX/XXXX and have been ignored and lied to along the way, and so I just had my deposits go back to my prepaid account that offered overdraft coverage at a higher amount and without a debacle over the difference between a deposit and a direct deposit.',\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'XX/XX/XXXX Once again complete lack of response from XXXX \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX I received a notification from the CFPB regarding complaint ID XXXX indicating that the complaint lists someone the company does not recognize as their customer or their customers authorized representative and XXXX requested my authorization to investigate. My authorization was promptly given via the CFPB website. Since, I have received no response from XXXX  regarding this investigation. In my dealings with XXXX they have exhibited a history of evasiveness, stonewalling and complete lack of response, including not responding to multiple inquiries of the WV State Attorney General as well as refusing multiple requests to send my complete file as required by section 609 of the FCRA. Specifically but not limited to I want to see the entire history of inquiries with end users especially after the excessive activity of SOFI Financial. \\n\\nAnd to make matters worse, in XXXX of XXXX I received suspicious emails that appear to be from both XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX indicating a security breach and that these accounts would be closed if I didnt respond. The thing is these accounts were closed over ten years ago. My question is, has XXXX or SOFI ever provided my information to employees of XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX or any other financial institution? \\n\\nFurthermore, the response from SOFI on XX/XX/XXXX is total nonsense. Though they are unable to locate an account for me they have accessed my data 30 times as indicated by the XXXX  online reports. XXXX says they have only done 3 soft pulls over this time period and want me to contact XXXX regarding these inquiries. But SOFI says, according to our records, we have sent 27 mailers to your address I have never once received a mailer from SOFI or meet their client profile. \\n\\nConsidering the evasiveness, lack of response, excessive and clear irregularities, I need some answers from both XXXX  and SOFI. If I dont receive within 15 days answers to these questions I will make certain that this file crosses the desk of the Enforcement Division of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and if that is not good enough we will move the FTC. \\n\\nXXXX  I want my complete file which is my right under FCRA Section 609, as of the effective date of the last complaint and as the section requires Identification of each person ( including each end-user Second, have you provided my information to anyone employed at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX or any other financial institution not listed on my online report? If so what was their legitimate purpose in accessing my financial data? \\n\\nSOFI, since you have such historical detail regarding accessing my XXXX  data, and considering XXXX does not want to fulfill their obligation, tell me how you got my social security number, and when did you start sending me mailers and accessing my data? Lastly, have you provided my information to anyone employed at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX or any other financial institution? \\n\\nI look forward to your response. My identification is attached,',\n",

And to contact all credit reporting agencies. \\nSoFi account is not mine. I HAD PULLED MY CREDIT REPORT, WHICH I DO EVERY 6 MONTHS.I WORK MANY HOURS FOR THE GOVERNMENT. \\nI ALSO WROTE THE XXXX OFFICE AND FTC IN RESPONSE. \\nI have no knowledge of it, no legal obligation for it and no information as to its origin. \\nThere is NO police REPORT or fraud AFFIDAVIT possible and no information or documentation in my possession in regard to the data contained in the tradeline CREDIT REPORT. \\n\\n\\nI got this bill and I just want to verify, validate that this bill is something that I owe. \\'\\' You know in these times of all this identity theft online and so on, this is just reasonable, good book keeping, okay? You sent me this? That does n\\'t mean I owe it. I just want you to prove that I owe this bill. That \\'s all I \\'m doing. I \\'m not being confrontational. I just want you to prove it the way the law says you have to prove it. I sent you a letter asking you to send me the correct documentation within 30 days that validates the debt. That \\'s the rule, that if I owe this bill. Here \\'s the issue. For any debt by a lending institution, you can not send me the information that I do in fact owe you. You ca n\\'t send it to me because you do n\\'t have it, okay? I got some bill in the mail, and there is something on my credit report. That \\'s kind of like a bill because it \\'s saying on my credit report there \\'s this derogatory account. In other words, a derogatory account or any listing of a tradeline account active is that someone \\'s saying I owe this bill and you have n\\'t paid us yet. So whether it \\'s a bill that comes in the mail or something on my credit report that \\'s negative, that \\'s another kind of a bill, all I am doing in now is basically this. I am asking you for the accounting records of this trade. \\n\\n\\nThe accounting records will show, legally, I gave you a promissory note and you gave me Federal Reserve notes. There was a debit entry into the accounting. There was a credit entry into the accounting. They cancelled each other out, debit for credit, credit for debit. The transaction was complete when the notes were traded. I do not owe you a penny. Your accounting records prove it. All I \\'m asking for is that proof : \" Could you show me your accounting records and that contract, the wet ink signature contract, or a copy of the contract that is affidavited? \\'\\' What does that mean, affidavited? In other words, somebody has to make a copy, then sign at the bottom, I made this copy and their signature is notarized. All I \\'m asking is, \" Please show me I how I owe this. I do n\\'t owe this? Well then you \\'re a fraud. You owe me money. It \\'s really simple. \\'\\' Court trying to explain to the judge the \" Original Signiture Agreement \\'\\' and Affidavit showing entry.',\n",

Mid XXXX, we were notified to perform a home appraisal for our home to assess the value. We paid and the home was finally appraised on XX/XX/2022. Since then, the application has been in \" underwriting process \\'\\' with the occasional documentation requirements that we would submit the same day.

They also said say that final disclosed term will only be sent the borrow for approval. This does not seem right. The consigner should always be notified and required to approve the final loan terms. Does the law allow bypassing the consigner? If so, the law should be changed to required consigner 's approval of the loan terms. Also, both agents said that they have received many other complaints about this. It only reasonable the consigner to know and approve of exactly what they are responsible for.

       "   'complaint_what_happened': \"My complaint is that 2 accounts were opened online, not by me, and certainly without my permission, using my identity. I do not understand how these accounts could be opened first of all online, and second without the presence of the individual to verify a signature, an address, proof of residency, and proof of identity. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX a loan with SOFI Lending was applied for in the amount of {$19000.00}. The loan was approved and funds transferred. All this came about when a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, from XXXX XXXX   was sent to an old address I had not lived at for more than 20 years. In this letter, it stated they denied opening an account for me, an account I never applied for. The letter suggested I contact the credit agencies to see if there was anything affecting my credit report. On XX/XX/XXXX, I went online and reviewed my XXXX Credit report where there was a recent inquiry for SOFI Lending. Not knowing who this company even was, I contacted them that same day to get some information. I spoke with XXXX who confirmed that a loan was applied for using my name, date of birth, home address, home phone number, but a different email address. I immediately let them know I did not request any type of loan with their company and they should put my claim in as a fraud incident. She informed me that a block would be put on the account for review and that they would get back to me with a reference number. It was XXXX who also informed me that the whole loan transaction was completed online. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I reported the identity theft to the FTC. I also added a freeze and security alerts with the three credit bureaus, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. I was able to make a police report in person at my home on XX/XX/XXXX with an Officer from my local police department. \\n\\nNot hearing back from XXXX XXXX, I called again on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to XXXX. It was then when I requested the reference # to my fraud case. When I asked what type of identification is given to show proof of identity, I was told that they request any of the following : a copy of a driver 's license, passport, or income statement. When I asked what they received I was told that it was the underwriting department that had this information on file. I asked to speak to the underwriting department but I was told that I could not. XXXX also mentioned that since I reported the incident, they would do an investigation and remove the loan from my credit report. It was also at this time when I was asked if I wanted their Fraud Packet, in which I did request. \\n\\nAfter receiving their fraud packet and reading through it, it requested giving more personal information such as my driver 's license ID # and copies verifying my address, driver 's license, passport, or utility bills. Of course not wanting them to have any more of my personal information than they already had, I made my third phone call XX/XX/XXXX. I began asking questions about this fraud packet but the specialist could not answer my questions, it was then that I asked to speak with their manager XXXX. After being on hold for more time than needed, a specialist, XXXX, picked up the line. Frustrated at this point, I asked my questions again, only to get the same unsure answers. I did continue pressing for answers, like why did they not make a phone call to verify my information prior to lending this money like the website states in the Q & A section ( XXXX had my home phone number on file ). I was told that sometimes these processes are not necessary and that their policies change depending on the need. Thats poor policy right there. I also asked how could it be that not one letter or any confirmation of the loan was sent to my home address ( also on file ), I was told the whole transaction was opened and completed online. I found this very hard to believe and needed to know more. Not knowing what type of account the {$19000.00} was transferred into, I asked where and to what type of account XXXX transferred the funds to. Again, not being able to give me all the information I needed, I was able to get the name of the bank, XXXX, and the last 4 digits of the account number. \\n\\nI then contacted XXXX XXXX  and spoke to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, I discovered that they too open accounts online. When I asked some of the specifics about the account such as identification given to open the account, address on the account, again I was road blocked and could not get the information I needed to protect myself from the fraud situation taking place. I alerted them too that although the account was opened in my name and with my social security number, it was a fraud and I did not authorize or open an account with them. They opened a fraud case number and informed me that I would be receiving a letter from them within 30 days. Since I did not request an account to be opened with XXXX, Im hoping that after receiving their letter ( not knowing what it even is going to read ) I will be able to close this account. Frustrated and upset, I pressed XXXX XXXX for further information as to the address attached to the account, they would not give me the address but when I asked if it was even in the state I live in, I was told it was not. I'm not sure how SOFI Lending could so easily transfer funds to an account without verifying that the information on the account matched the information in their files. \\n\\nSimple steps could have been taken to alert me to this incident sooner. SOFI Lending has failed to do any : 1 ) Send a letter, perhaps with an ID pin to the address associated with the person who's social security number is being used for the account. The letter, once received with the ID pin, could be used to call the company to confirm that the letter was received at the proper address. \\n2 ) Require additional information such as copies of utility bills, paystub, or insurance bills to again verify the address 3 ) Compare and verify the address and all information on the account funds are transferred to 4 ) Make a phone call like stated on their website in the Q & A section\",\n",

I then called them and initiated the process of getting a loan. They directed me to the SoFi website and said that they would be the best option for loan and told me to go ahead and complete the process of applying. I did not know that the person I was talking to was not associated or had a partnership with SoFi so I thought it was all normal. The entire process took a lot of documentation to complete and I was working with an underwriter names XXXX that at first was very helpful. Towards the end of the process of getting approved and submitting the final documents I asked XXXX if the company that led me to them had to be paid their fee or if there was a way to avoid that. My questions was due to them not helping at all in the approval and documentation portion. To my surprise she had no idea there was another company involved and told me that we'd have to create a new account separate from the one that was pretty much approved. When I created another account it pulled my credit score again and declined my application ( They are supposed to use the same report for  60 days if I am not mistaken ). When that happened XXXX said she would talk to her supervisor and see if they can override that decision since I was already in the process of being approved and all documents looked good. She said she would get back to me and let me know. She never did and I had to call her for a decision. She told me that there was nothing they could do and the original account that was approved was now auto-declined as fraud!!! I was completely caught off guard and upset that I was being penalized for being honest and for not knowing that the people I first talked to were not working with SoFi. I then called the gentleman from XXXX XXXX to tell him what happened and that we were no longer working together. He explained that he has no way of intercepting funds, and that our agreement was under a power of attorney and his fee would only be due after I had received the money. Completely separate. I told him I still did not want to continue to work with them and the said that would not be a problem. I called XXXX to explain that I no longer had any obligations with them and that if there was any way we can plead to her superiors to use my original credit report for the new account or to open a new application. She said she would check with them and let me know ASAP. A week went by and no word from XXXX. I then called today to see if I can get an update and now conveniently it is against their policy to transfer me to speak to XXXX and they able to put in a call back request but can not guarantee that it will be XXXX to call me back. I had been working with XXXX the entire time and had no issue speaking to her and she left me multiple messages to call her back before the incident and again no issues reaching her. Now that I am auto declined for something that is not my fault she is conveniently either no there or against their policy for me to speak to her. This leads me to believe that XXXX is avoiding me rather than helping me fix this issue. Horrible\",\n",

I spoke to their Customer Account Specialist and they worked alongside me and my ex fiancee. They explained as long as I made payments on time, I would be able to release the co-signer on my loan. About a year or two into this loan, they no longer offer this option. I am not with my fiancee anymore and would like his name released. \\n\\nI've applied for Covid-19 assistance ( in XXXX and XXXX ), and have only been able to get a 30 day forbearance when they offer up to 90 days. I am also out of a job, and I don't know how I'll be able to pay {$1000.00} on top of rent, phone, car, insurance, credit card and other utilities. \\n\\nThey've also denied ( XX/XX/XXXX ) my application for deferment while I'm in-school. I've accepted to enroll in graduate school this summer. However, if I ask for any assistance, forbearance, or deferment my application gets denied. I'd like to be able to make payments when I'm employed full-time. I don't see how SoFi expects me to pay my student loan, when I don't have a steady income.\",\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'On XX/XX/XXXX we applied to refinance our mortgage loan with Sofi. We signed disclosures and provided all documentation as requested by the loan officer based on emails received until XX/XX/XXXX when i was pre approved. \\nThen, everything stopped. I contacted Sofi Loan originator and Member Specialist starting on XXXX to find out the status of the loan. Several emails were sent by me and the Loan originator to the Member Specialist with no result. Finally, on XX/XX/XXXX I contacted Sofi management making them know how disappointed I was about the lack of communication/interest in my loan. On XX/XX/XXXX I was contacted by an Operation Manager who apologized for the previous Member Specialists lack of communication and that they assigned you a new Member Specialist that was a lot better with communication. \\nThe new Member specialist asked for a couple other documents that we provided right away. We then were notified that our closing date was set for XX/XX/XXXX ( but cancelled ) and then XX/XX/XXXX and that I will have to pay about {$200.00} for closing cost at closure. Nevertheless, on XX/XX/XXXX I received a call from the Member specialist that the closing will have to be cancelled because they missed a document ( Home Equity Refinance Disclosure ) that I needed to sign since I are from Texas. This will also require to wait 12 days before closure. It is to note that the disclosure was only a notification but the specialist want me to just sign somewhere and return to them. \\nOn XX/XX/XXXX I communicated to the Member specialist my dissatisfaction for the continuous cancellations and that we wanted assurances that the third time was going to be the charm. \\nI also asked several questions ( answers in parenthesis received on XX/XX/XXXX ) : 1. Are you going to send us another closing package with corrected amounts, dates, etc.? I guess we need to start over with the XXXX signatures. ( You may get another closing disclosure but this will NOT reset the waiting period. It is just for you to see the current actual numbers if anything was updated ) Yes, the lock has been extended and your interest rate is the same. \\n3. When is our first payment will going to be now? - Since we are closing in XXXX your first payment will be in XXXX. \\n\\nIt is interested to note the email that the Member specialist sent on XX/XX/XXXX asking : \" I believe 12 days was the time frame for the TX HELOC waiting period, is this calendar days or business days. I would like to re- schedule the closing today, but need to know the earliest day the member can close. \\'\\' This shows the lack of knowledge of regulations. \\nThat same day I asked again about the closing documents : \" Am I going to get a new set of CD? The current final documents have different numbers, dates, etc. Is that also going to affect the closing date? I expect that we will know soon what are the closing cost, closing date, etc. \\'\\' On XXXX I was notified of the ( third ) closing date was set for XXXX. \\nOn XXXX I again communicated to Sofi \\'s Member specialist my concerns about closing : \" I received the invite for closing scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX. Do you know when I am going to get the final Closing Documents? The current final documents need several updates. I would like to know at least how much is the cash to close. Would my wife and I need to sign new documents? \\'\\' Late XXXX I finally got a call let me know that the closure cost were now $ XXXX!!!!! This was due that since the loan took so long to process we now were less than 2 months from paying the taxes, insurance, etc. \\nWhat really made us to be concerned us was that the member specialist suggest that to \" help us \\'\\' Sofi could add the extra $ XXXX to our loan. This suggestion made my wife and I very concerned about Sofi \\'s ways to do business and made us loose trust on Sofi.\\n\\nAfter three months working on our refinance and three unsuccessful closing dates, we decided that we rather not do business with Sofi since we consider that we were unfairly treated by Sofi and that they either wanted to deny us the loan ( discrimination? red lining? ) or wanted to make more money increasing the loan amount as suggested.',\n",

The amount refinanced was {$31000.00}. \\n\\nAt the time, SoFi aggressively marketed their loans, advertising that they could save customers thousands of dollars with their lower rates. They never clearly communicated to me the risks of losing the benefits that could potentially be offered by the federal government : for example the recent laws passed and executive orders signed granting relief from payments and accrued interest, and the possibility of student loan forgiveness. This information may have been in the fine print, but they did not make efforts to make it apparent. I reviewed all the email communications I received when initiating the loans and this information was not presented.\\n\\nSoFi is now adding this kind of disclaimer to their marketing efforts ( see attached ). This disclaimer is now on at least one of their websites : \" NOTICE : Recent legislative changes have suspended all federal student loan payments and waived interest charges on federally held loans until XX/XX/XXXX. Please carefully consider these changes before refinancing federally held loans with SoFi, as in doing so you will no longer qualify for these changes or other current or future benefits applicable to federally held loans. \\'\\' SoFi is allowing some forbearance ( 60 days ) now but they are not halting the accrual of interest ( see attached ). \\n\\nI believe that by not explicitly warning their customers about the risk of losing these benefits they are engaging in predatory lending practices.',\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': \"On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, my daughter started an application with SOFI to refinance her private student loans. The rate she was quoted was high, so she listed me as a co-signer to get a lower rate. I received an application to complete as a co-signer. Once completed on line, I expected to see the new rate offered on the loan. However, all I received was a loan agreement to sign stating that I would make payments etc. When I called SOFI and spoke to a random agent, she said I could not see the rates and terms until I signed the loan agreement. She told me what the original rate was that my daughter qualified for on her own, but would n't discuss what the new proposed rates were since I had n't signed the loan agreement ( remember we are still in the application phase of this loan. ) When I refused to sign the loan agreement until I saw the terms, she suggested that I contact my daughter and have her look up the terms. My daughter discussed the terms she received which sounded reasonable so I went ahead and signed the loan agreement. However, I still had no access to the terms. My daughter signed her loan agreement and I received an email on XXXX XXXX, XXXX saying that she had signed the loan documents. I went on line to view the terms and still was not granted access. I called and was connected with a random agent and explained that as a co-signer I had the right to view the terms of the loan. The agent said that my daughter was the primary borrower and I was only there in case of default so I was not entitled to see the loan terms and documents. He suggested that I sign in as my daughter so I could see them. I am a co-signer on the loan, not a guarantor. I believe that banking regulations treat co-signers as co-borrowers and am appalled that I had to sign a commitment to pay without seeing the terms first hand in a document. Even after I signed and requested the loan documents, I was denied access. I realize SOFI is not a bank, and have contacted you to make this a formal complaint. I have had to commit via a loan agreement to a refi of a student loan of just over {$99000.00} without seeing any of the terms.\",\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': \"I signed up for a member ship with sofi a few month 's ago i started to utilize the services offered. Then in the beginning of XXXX i had a issue with my external bank account where i was getting unauthorized transactions so my bank advises me that they need to send a stop payment to all my transactions to be able get my funds back. So i contracted sofi to let them know what the situation and was and sofis customer service told me my account will be at a negative and that to avoid any account fees i needed to make another transfer to being my account current. So on XX/XX/2019 i transferred {$20000.00} because i ended up closing my external account due to fear of my account being tampered with i then transfered my remaining balance to my sofi account. So my sofi membership account holds my funds totaling {$35000.00}. My complaint is sofi isnt even a bank how are they able to hold all my money and not release my funds to me its been 7 days they have bern with holding my funds and thats not right. I feel like they are breaking some sort of law because it's my money it came from my external bank. Ive tired emailing calling and they do not give me no answers yet my funds just sit there. I thought that maybe its due to assumption of illegal account activity but that's not possible because they make you log into your external bank to verify account owner ship. I just want my funds to be accessible for my use not to be held by a company that isn't even a bank.\",\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'My experience with XXXX Mortgage XXXX has been the worst experience with a mortgage company to date. I was lied to on multiple occasions and now I learn I was lied to in the most foul way that could cost my family {$30000.00}. The origination process with Sofi Mortgage was easy but starting early in the process I had many misgivings about extra fees but went through with the process. Once the time came to process the loan I went through multiple \" member specialists. \\'\\' They did not complete tasks they said they would, did not follow up in a timely manner and outright lied about stipulations of the loan. We ended up having to bring more money than expected to closing. During the time of acquiring the loan I let it be known that my husband and I were in dealings with the State and would be negotiating the price of a portion of our land for the road widening happening in front of our home. I was told that our loan would have no issues with our dealings with the State and they did not conflict with each other as long as our loan was in good standing. After initially being told our loan would close in early XXXX, the loan did not fund until XXXX due to issues with Sofi. Currently, my husband and I have made an agreement with the State of Texas for a portion of our property to be bought for road expansion. The last needed document for the transaction to close is a partial release from Sofi. I contacted Sofi for this document who then sent me an email address to request the form from. I received a denial letter a week later stating that it was due to our loan not being seasoned for 12 months. I then contacted the Partial Release Department and learned that that part of Sofi is actually serviced by XXXX. I was advised that I could ask for an exception for the partial release from XXXX  XXXX. I THEN had to contact XXXX  XXXX  and asked what needed to happen in order to request the exception for the partial release. I was then referred back to the \" servicer \\'\\' in order for a Form 236 to be filled out. Once I contacted Cenlar back in regards to this form I was told that they could help with this request but the form would need to be filled out, I would have to acquire appraisals and a lot of other tasks that would be forwarded to me. I am beside myself to put this plainly. We trusted a company to help us get the best mortgage possible for our family and it has turned into one issue after another since XXXX of last year. I have raised my concerns with Sofi through the mortgage process and I simply given an \" I\\'m sorry \\'\\' and we will get this fixed to which the issues were never fixed. I feel like this loan was predatory in nature. My husband and I are hard, honest workers. We work hard for the home we have. We pay our mortgage and take care of our responsibilities but I feel like we have been trampled all over by Sofi Lending. Had I known the truth and knew that not having a loan for 12 months would make this process with the State come to a head then I would not have signed the loan agreements.

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'I am having an issue with my loan refinancing agency. I have refinanced my private loans through XXXX, and Sofi/XXXX XXXX. The loan is a 7 year XXXX refinance loan with an interest rate of 5.375 % fixed loan. The loan was issued XX/XX/XXXX. The initial agreement was for a $ XXXX monthly payment for a total of 54 months. I applied for the loan during my XXXX XXXX and finished my XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. After XXXX, I pursued a fellowship in XXXX XXXX. I am currently not an XXXX XXXX and have one and a half years left before I can start getting paid like one. Since my XXXX was finished the loan reverted to full payment after 6 mths. I applied to re-instate the {$100.00} as I had not utilized the full 54 month period. However, my application was declined because the loan company had realized that my school was not a XXXX XXXX school at the time of my graduation. They told me it was an accident that they even let me refinance in the first place, as they did not check this prior to issuing my loan. However, now they are charging me about $ XXXX/month. I only make {$62000.00} yearly and am in no way able to pay this off with my current salary. I have called them numerous times and have been constantly redirected between SOFI, and SOFI/XXXX. I tried to apply for forbearance through SOFI/XXXX, and they declined my application as they reported I am do not meet the criteria for economic hardship. I then looked to refinance my current loan again through SOFI and they keep declining stating that my school is not a Title IV school so they would not make any changes on the loan. In short, the loan company is not allowing any flexibility in reducing my loan payments or restoring the original contract to {$100.00}. I know that once I do become an XXXX XXXX, I will be more than capable of paying off my loans but as it stands I currently am unable to do so. Additionally, I am unable to refinance the loan through other companies as even they believe my monthly payments would be more than my current income. Please help me address these issues, as they do not seem to care about my ability to pay the loans.',\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'I began my initial application process with SoFi XX/XX/2017. My existing loan is a federal consolidation loan with XXXX XXXX. I applied with my father, a partially retired XXXX as my co-signer, as recommended by SoFi for help in approving a lower interest rate quoted initially at 4.95 %. The following documents were requested initially : recent pay stubs from employer, current loan billing statements, XXXX, and copies of personal identification documents. The process then became unwieldy with incessant requests for more documentation. One of the first requests was for my co-signer to upload his last 6 months of bank  statements as his recent retirement made his last pay stub unreliable to reflect his income. My co-signer and I were under the impression this would suffice to complete the application. Then again, I received another notification for additional documentation including my co-signers XXXX and statement of retirement income. And yet again, this did not suffice. My father and I began reaching out to customer service and spoke with various specialists assuring us that all that was needed was just a one more document. There was only one email early on in the application process which outlined the requested documentation ( see attached ). After this, there was no instruction about which documents were needed but rather I had to navigate through my account online and deduce which sections were missing an attached document. This resulted in time consuming calls to customer serve and with equivocal recommendations.\\n\\nEventually my application expired for incompleteness despite reassurance from an account specialist that application would not expire if I was actively working on completing the upload of additional documentation requested. I decided to re-apply and had to start the whole process over and a host of new documents were requested including new pay stubs, XXXX documents from co-signer, a new drivers license photo with better resolution, IRA statements, 401K information, deferred income statement from co-signer and co-signer tax returns from last 2 years. We thought we were finally complete with the new application when a request for both my co-signer and myself to contact our employers and have them complete these eight requests : name, job title, date of hire, confirmation of pay frequency, confirmation of salary, confirmation that the employee is employed, confirmation of job status, and validation of work contract ( see attached ). \\n\\nAt this point I was fed up with the charade of requested documentation and the fact SoFi, a reputable name in the student loan refinance industry, would request my employer to get involved with my personal debts. This was an absurd request and it was very odd that this was not brought up at the beginning of the application process. I therefore requested to close my application and requested to talk with account specialist to ensure all my documentation was destroyed as SoFi had in their possession numerous private financial information. Given SoFis history of poor customer service, I was not surprised when I reached out to SoFi customer service and was told that all escalation specialists were busy but that one would return my call. I never received a call. I am extremely disappointed with the cumbersome nature of the SoFi application process and hope I can save others from this frustration. Furthermore, SoFi needs to be investigated for their inability to properly and truthfully explain the application for student loan refinancing.',\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'There are three problems with the way I was treated by SoFi : ( 1 ) First, on XX/XX/XXXX, I responded to a solicitation by email, from SoFi, which said I would be given a .25 % discount on a student loan refinance, if application were submitted before XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX I filled out an on-line application for refinancing my private student loan. In the online application, I listed my net income as {$150000.00}, based on the income I have earned this year, XX/XX/XXXX. SoFi \\'s application did not request, at that point in time, that I list my income from years prior to XX/XX/XXXX ; it merely asked for a statement of my income. Then, On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email saying I was pre-approved for a rate of 4.25 %, with monthly payments of {$490.00}, fixed rate for 15 years. On XX/XX/XXXX, I responded to SoFi \\'s request for tax forms for the years XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, along with additional financial information, which I provided. I am self-employed and received net income of {$90000.00} in XX/XX/XXXX and {$110000.00} in XX/XX/XXXX, respectively. Between XXXX and the XXXX XXXX, I received two more emails requesting additional financial information, to which I responded with a total of 30 pages of documents. At no time did SoFi ask me to clarify my ( correctly stated ) statement of income for XX/XX/XXXX. I continued to see on my SoFi dashboard that the rate I had been offered would expire on XX/XX/XXXX. Then, that same day, XX/XX/XXXX, I received another email from SoFi, which revoked my offer of 4.25 % and replaced it with a new offer of 5.175 %. \\n\\nThe explanation provided by SoFi was as follows : \" The interest rate quote we initially provided was based on the {$150000.00} annual income entered in your application. However, the income entered in your application differed from the income we were able to verify using the documents we received. Due to this discrepancy, your interest rate quote has changed. \\'\\' I believe SoFi \\'s application process was unfair because the income I provided at the outset was correct and I was not presented an opportunity to prove it. The low, 4.25 % rate offered was merely bait to induce me to do a lot of work to apply, only to receive a higher rate, based on an incorrect explanation. \\n\\nNote : I have more than enough disposable income to pay the monthly amount required by either of SoFi \\'s offers. My credit score is XXXX. I receive numerous solicitations weekly to open up new lines of credit. SoFi \\'s justification for increasing the interest rate, based on what SoFi incorrectly states was an inconsistent statement of income, is baseless and was merely a pretext to increase the interest rate that it offered, and unfairly induced me to engage in their loan application process. \\n\\n\\n( 2 ) Second, today, XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter by email from SoFi that revoked my offer of 4.25 % and replaced it with a higher offer of 5.175 %, under an expiring deadline for SoFi \\'s initial offer of 4.25 %. I believe providing a deadline for a low rate, and then revoking it with less than 24 hours left under the deadline, after a fair attempt to comply, is a pressure tactic and is unethical it itself. This method of conducting business is also a burden to me, and probably countless other consumers, because of the weeks I have invested in pursuing SoFi \\'s original offer. \\n\\n\\n( 3 ) Third, SoFi has no internal complaint process for consumers. I was able to speak to a manager, on a recorded line, but he said there is nothing he can do to help me. I asked for the opportunity to speak to someone at a higher level, or to file a formal complaint, or to engage in arbitration to address my complaint, but he said there is no one else to speak to, there is no internal complaint process for consumers, and there is no arbitration program. However, the manager said that he was filing a \" complaint \\'\\' for SoFi \\'s records, to improve the application process but not to provide me, the consumer, with any avenue for relief. He said there would be a record number generated after our call, but when I asked him for the record number, he said he could not provide it unless SoFi receives a court order to provide it. He said I could probably get a copy of the phone recording, but only if a court orders it. I asked him for his full name, but he would not provide it, except for his first name and last initial ( \" XXXX XXXX \\'\\' ). I asked him for an acknowledgment by email that I had complained, with a copy of SoFi \\'s \" quality control \\'\\' complaint number, but again he said I do not have the right to receive any record of my concerns. In sum, I believe SoFi is engaging in \" bait and switch \\'\\' tactics with consumers, is arbitrarily revoking offers and replacing them with dramatically higher offers, and is not serving consumers or the business community by failing to have ANY internal dispute resolution process to resolve customer complaints.',\n",

I contacted all the merchants in an attempt to dispute the transactions directly with them. Most of the merchants told me to file a dispute with my bank, that they can not just refund a card. One of the merchants told me that nothing matched my information, specifically my name. Meaning the name used to make all these online transations wasn\\'t mine. The explaination also states no failed pin attempts. All of these transaction were online, no merchant asked for your pin for an online transation.

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'My loan has been grossly and intentionally mishandled by agents of both SoFi and XXXX, which I aggregate for purposes of this report. The two institutions have colluded with each other to coerce me into making payments on my loan which should be in deferment. I have to date spent countless hours speaking with agents at both institutions as well as administrative and executive officers at my university in an attempt to solve a problem that SoFi-XXXX has created regarding the status of my loan. I have been very polite and cooperative for several months. However, it has become clear to me that SoFi-XXXX has intentionally established and implemented policies in order to abuse its power as a lender, harass me, inflict emotional distress on me, and coerce me into making payments which I am not obligated to make pursuant to my loan agreement. SoFi-XXXX has fraudulently recorded my loan as delinquent internally when it is in fact in good standing since I am a XXXX XXXX and I have furnished SoFi-XXXX with countless documents to that effect in a timely manner and when requested. In addition, SoFi-XXXX has fraudulently reported my account as delinquent to XXXX   for the current balance of {$14000.00}, and I continue to be subjected to harassment by XXXX representatives for payments I am not legally obligated to make. I have set forth the details of SoFi-XXXX fraudulent, abusive and harassing conduct below. \\n\\nBefore this problem, my account with SoFi-XXXX was at all times in good standing and I have always made payments on time. In XX/XX/XXXX, I returned to school to begin a XXXX. program. I therefore contacted SoFi-XXXX well in advance of this date to arrange for an in-school deferment. SoFi-XXXX had required that its deferment requests be signed and stamped by the university registrar. The first form I submitted on XX/XX/XXXX was denied on the basis that my program would not begin until XX/XX/XXXX of that year. On XX/XX/XXXX, therefore, I submitted a new form for in-school deferment, which was accepted. The loan was properly put into deferment. SoFi-XXXX, as I was informed, has a policy that deferments are to be processed in three-month intervals, with a new form being submitted each time. Although this policy is not in my loan agreement, I understand that policies are usually established in order to foster efficient administration. So I complied with the policy politely, despite the fact that the process is terribly inconvenient because it requires quite a bit of processing time on both ends resulting from SoFi-XXXX unreasonably demanding requirements. The next form, which I submitted on XX/XX/XXXX, was also accepted. \\n\\nHowever, the form I submitted on XX/XX/XXXX was denied. It is at this point that the pattern of abuse and coercion by SoFi-XXXX begins. The reason given for this first denial was that the form did not indicate that I was enrolled in a graduate program. This is an entirely unreasonable grounds for a rejection of this form. To begin with, SoFi-XXXX has information in my file indicating that I have already obtained an XXXX degree, an XXXX degree, and a XXXX   degree. Moreover, the first two forms for the Fall semester, which indicated I was enrolled in a XXXX program, were accepted and on file. A student can not be downgraded from a XXXX   candidate to an XXXX candidate at the same university. And in any case, even if this were possible, it would make no sense for me to switch to an XXXX program since I already held an XXXX and several advanced degrees, which was well known to SoFi and XXXX. In any case, as the registrar of my university explained to me, it filled out the form correctly. The form asks for the program of study, which is essentially the discipline in which the candidate is studying. It does not ask for the degree program, which is why the registrar did not include this information. Nonetheless, I returned to the registrar, had them indicate XXXX on the form, and resubmitted it. The registrar sent it in directly, and it seems that SoFi-XXXX ignored this form. I then submitted it myself on XX/XX/XXXX. This second form was then rejected on the ground that it was the same form whereas a new form must be submitted. Again, this was simply a delay tactic by SoFi-XXXX. There is absolutely no difference in the forms and no reason why a brand new one should be submitted other than to delay the process. Such abusive delay tactics became clear when SoFi-XXXX then shifted my account into repayment even though it was clear to all parties that I was still a XXXX XXXX and the forms I was submitting were being rejected on purely administrative and unreasonable grounds. Since I had been on an automatic payment program in order to keep the interest rate down, SoFi-XXXX deducted my bank account for the amount they fraudulently recorded as due for the month of XX/XX/XXXX. I was told by a XXXX representative that XXXX would not refund such payment even if the deferment were appropriately reinstated for that period. This constitutes theft, and I have therefore been forced by SoFi-XXXX to take my account off automatic repayment to protect myself from similar theft by them in the future, which increases the interest rate to their benefit. I then diligently submitted a third form for the same period. XXXX did not find any administrative insufficiencies in this form, but rejected it anyway for timeliness : they delayed so long reviewing and unreasonably rejecting the previous forms and the most recent one that when they finally made a decision on the most recent one, the academic semester had ended. XXXX claimed that the form verified me as a student only though XX/XX/XXXX ( the end of the academic semester ), and even though that period obviously covered the month of XX/XX/XXXX, they rejected it outright. In the first place, as will be further explained below, the form does not verify me as a student only though the end of the semester. What it does is verify that I am enrolled in courses that end in the Spring. In order to verify my continued enrollment, I submitted another form on XX/XX/XXXX indicating my course enrollment for the Fall semester. This form was rejected on the basis that its period was too far in the future. After explaining all of this to another representative at XXXX, I was told that the two forms were reviewed together by SoFi ( finally ) and rejected yet again, this time on the different yet similarly unreasonable basis that the form covering the Spring semester ( ending XX/XX/XXXX ) would, according to SoFi-XXXX   arbitrary three-month period policy, only cover the months of XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX and because it covered only two months and not three or more, it was invalid. \\n\\nAfter countless hours speaking with representatives from both institutions, I learned that XXXX ( whose agents had claimed SoFi had been responsible for all the decisions ) had forwarded only the first form to SoFi. XXXX representatives claimed SoFi had decision-making power over these forms, while SoFi claimed XXXX had decision-making power over the standing and reporting of my account. Over the course of these months, I had several long conversations with representatives, each promising me that the issue would be addressed and that I would be contacted once it had been resolved. Meanwhile, XXXX representatives continued to threaten me with reporting my account as delinquent to credit bureaus and continued to harass me every day on the telephone. It is clear that both institutions were colluding to coerce me into making payments that I am clearly not required to make under the loan agreement governing my loan. \\n\\nThe essential facts here are that I have been at all relevant times, and continue to be, a XXXX XXXX at a degree-granting program for a XXXX degree, and I have submitted several times documents attesting to this status, all in a timely and cooperative manner despite the unreasonable demands imposed upon me by SoFi-XXXX. SoFi-XXXX has rejected all these documents, each on distinct and unreasonable grounds and after unreasonable delays, citing so-called policies that are nowhere to be found in my loan agreement. As I have explained to several agents at SoFi-XXXX, SoFi-XXXX accepts forms only when signed by the university registrar. As I have explained to SoFi-XXXX several times, the university registrar can verify only that I am registered for classes for any given semester. My XXXX program operates on the semester system. Thus, there is a Fall semester and a Spring semester. There is no Summer semester. However, one does not cease being a student during the periods in which classes are not held. There is no summer term in my XXXX program and I am therefore not enrolled in classes over the summer, but I am nonetheless a XXXX   student. By the same token, one does not cease being a student on weekends or national holidays when classes are not held. I have submitted evidence of continued enrollment for the Fall XX/XX/XXXX term as further proof of my status and have also offered several times to have the dean of the college send in a letter attesting to my status if need be, evidence which would cover the summer months during classes are not held. However, SoFi-XXXX has declined to accept such evidence and has indicated that it accepts only documents signed by the university registrar. SoFi-XXXX has thus established and implemented a so-called policy that creates requirements that can not possibly be met. This is bad faith conduct, unreasonable, and not valid grounds for denying an in-school deferment under the loan agreement. \\n\\nPursuant to the terms of my loan agreement, which governs the rights and obligations of me and SoFi, I have the right to defer my loan if I am a XXXX XXXX. No specific policies are incorporated into that agreement, and at any rate, any policies not disclosed to me at the time I signed the loan agreement which are established and implemented by Sofi-XXXX in such a way as to vitiate my rights under that agreement are simply unenforceable. SoFi-XXXX might require submission of forms for deferment every three months, but they can not deny deferment simply because those arbitrary three-month periods do not coincide with the academic calendar of any given university. Likewise, Sofi-XXXX may require that the student status verifications be prepared by the university registrar, but they can not deny deferment on the ground that the universitys semesters do not coincide with the arbitrary three-mon period established by SoFi or XXXX when the registrar can only attest to course enrollment by semester. \\n\\nSection I.2 ( a ) of the loan agreement gives me the right to defer the loan if I return to school as a XXXX XXXX pursuing a graduate degree and submit evidence to that effect. They say nothing about being enrolled for courses, and the reason they dont is that being a student is not dependent on being enrolled in courses. The more general provision in Section I.1 stating that the decision to grant a request for forbearance is at the sole discretion of the lender arguably does not apply even by its terms because we are dealing with a deferment, not a forbearance. But in any case, even if it were intended to apply to deferment, it would not be applicable because the much more detailed Section 2 delineates specific requirements for in-school deferment, and specific provisions take precedence  over general ones in the event of discrepancy. In addition, Section I.2 ( a ) would serve absolutely no purpose if all decisions on deferment were at the sole discretion of the lender regardless of whether any specific requirements were met. In such a case, deferment would not be available to me even if I submitted reasonable evidence of student status, which Section I.2 ( a ) clearly contemplates. Provisions in contracts are not interpreted in such a way as to render other provisions meaningless. \\n\\nI have satisfied the requirements set forth in Section I.2 ( a ) of the loan agreement several times for the period in question and in a timely manner. The essential fact is that, in a degree-granting doctoral program, active course enrollment is not required to be considered a XXXXXXXX XXXX. This is why the loan agreement refers to being a student, not necessarily being enrolled in courses. If Sofi-XXXX contends I have not satisfied those requirements, then those requirements are unreasonable and Sofi-XXXX is violating the loan agreement. This is an act of bad faith, and good faith in executing contracts is implied no matter what the contracts terms. \\n\\nI have made interest payments as I had been since I became a XXXX XXXX for the periods in question as required of me by my loan agreement, as my loan is rightly in deferral. My loan is therefore in good standing, and any statement or conduct to any other effect by SoFi-XXXX is fraudulent.',\n",

In hindsight outside requesting my social security number ( they did not and this was not provided ) this was an application for credit. Why must we fill out an application for credit to obtain rates for a refinance. \\nWhen I hit enter on the web site or as they wrote \" submit to see my rate \\'\\' I was declined. I then received a form letter ( digital ) stating \" After carefully reviewing your application, we are sorry to advise you that we can not grant a loan to you at this time. If you would like a statement of specific reasons why your application was denied, please contact our SoFi XXXX XXXX XXXX within 60 days of the date of this letter. We will provide you with the statement of reasons within 30 days after receiving your request. \\nI phoned SoFi to figure out what was going on and explain I did not request credit from them, I only wanted rates. I was told that they pull a \" soft \\'\\' inquiry on my credit and based on that I was declined. Ok .... It did not seem to me that I was granting them the ability to \" soft \\'\\' check my credit or that I was applying for credit .... I just wanted rates. \\nIn my humble 15 years as a Consumer Underwriter and Manager for a XXXX bank that must adhere to all the CFPB requirements, that this was a very deceitful tactics to create an application and render an unwanted credit decision, good or bad. The Website is very misleading and very upsetting to me as a consumer that to find rates I must first be run through a credit check?

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'Hello, We have a personal loan with SoFi and in late XXXX & XXXX were unable to make some of our loan payments. We let SoFi know that we were struggling due to my job loss and we had never been late on any other loan ( please see credit report for confirmation of this ). We tried to dispute this through each credit bureau to no avail. Weve done this multiple times but each time SoFi does nothing to remove the 3 negative late payments on our credit report. I have been able to get a couple jobs in my industry throughout COVID however there have been many layoffs. SoFi has allowed us at least twice to pay less than our full payment, which has helped but at this point they said there is nothing more they can do for us, even though I lost my job last year. The last time I spoke with a representative at SoFi I asked her am I supposed to pay you instead of my mortgage and groceries? in order to not have another late ( s )? She basically shrugged my statement off. Now I am blessed more than many others in this country and around the world that my husband does work, however we still cant pay our monthly bills without me working as well. I have over {$90000.00} in student loan debt to pay, etc, etc. I need SoFi to do the right thing and remove the lates it is showing erroneously on our credit report. This company has been terrible to work with and does not have the consumers interest at heart. If this is happening to myself, I can not imagine how it might be affecting other families out there who are struggling to maintain their credit scores but keep food on their table.',\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': \"Approximate one month ago ( XXXX. XXXX, 2022, I believe ), I found that I couldn't use my SoFi credit card and the app indicated that I needed to activate it. This was strange since I'd had the card for quite a while without issue, so it shouldn't have suddenly needed activation, like a new card would. I called SoFi that day and they told me the card had been reported as lost or stolen and was deactivated. I asked them when this happened and they told me it was the day before I called them, which I had not done. \\n\\nDuring my call, I asked for them to investigate who made the request since I am the only person authorized to make this type of request. I was told I would be contacted within two weeks, but more than two weeks later, I still haven't gotten a reply. I also asked why they didn't send an email or letter informing me of this as every other credit card issuer does and I didn't get an answer. The agent said she did not know either. \\n\\nI have still received no information and my account is still frozen. I believe this practice is unfair since I am not being informed about decisions that affect my identity and security, as well as not being provided with information about how this could have occurred. I do not believe that SoFi is properly investigating this and has been negligent in taking action on potential fraud. They also have not provided me a case number, telling me only that I will be contacted and provided the case number, which also has not happened.\",\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'I refinanced my student loans wit h SoFi. I ha d multiple federal and private loans, so  the ultimate goal wa s to consolidate all of them and save money, of course. SoFi puts out a lot of advertisement on how they can save people so much money with their student loans, and that is why I chose them. They only go up to a 20 year plan, and my loan is over  XXXX . Currently, my payments are around {$750.00} a month. I am  only one yea r out of graduating college and have a good job and have even been promoted twice, but I still am struggling mightily with these loans. You would be hard pressed to find someone 1 year out of college that would not be struggling to cover {$750.00} a month just for student loans. The student loan payment is more than my car payment plus rent combined. I have called them multiple times to ask what they can do to help me lower my payments because I am currently not saving any money, which was the whole point of doing this. Almost every other company can offer things like income-based payments or a longer term deal. Either way, I need a better payment structure ; every time I call them to ask what they can do to help they always tell me that there is nothing they can do. The y give one o ption which is to switch to a fixed rate. Well, that makes no sense because the current fixed rate is around 8 %. My current variable rate is around 5.5 %. Being on a variable rate can be very dangerous, especially for someone in my situation, but it is the only way I can possibly make any of these payments. The only other thing they mention besides switching to a fixed rate is to call  XXXX , who is actually servicing the loan. If I call  XXXX , they tell me to call SoFi. They just send you back and forth, and that is not a good look. I always ask them if they can push my term out t o 25 or   30 years, because that will definitely lower my payments. It would also be a GREAT business decision on their part, because they can make even more money off of interest from me over a 30 year span. To me, I understand that I a spending more money on interest, but that gives me more money to invest now, and also will allow me to breathe with lower payments. However, they always say that there is nothing they can do to help me. Plain and simple, I need a better payment structure. They are making money off of me no matter what, so there should not be any problem with switching up the payment structure. My current plan has a balance of around  XXXX  and has a projection of me spending a total of  XXXX  including interest over the life of the loan. That shows that they are going to be making a lot of money off of me. Surely they can do something to help me out given that I am helping them make so much money. Right now, they are doing nothing to help me out.',\n",

For employment verification, my employer sends a password protected PDF to the entity, and sends me the password for the PDF. It is my responsibility to provide that password to the entity. I requested through my employer on XXXX/XXXX/16 that they send employment verification to \" XXXXXXXXXXXX \\'\\'. I received the password from my employer and sent it to SoFi at XXXX XXXX, XXXX/XXXX/16. On Tuesday, XXXX/XXXX/16, I received word from SoFi that the employment verification was only good for a short period of time in their system, and they requested a new employment verification. I again requested employment verification from my employer be sent to \" XXXXXXXXXXXX \\'\\'. I received the password and sent the password to SoFi at XXXX XXXX, on XXXX/XXXX/16. I called SoFi after sending the password to confirm they had received both the verification document and the password. The phone representative allegedly spoke with the Reviewer for our application, and they confirmed they had both the document and the password. About XXXX CDT, on XXXX/XXXX/16, I checked the SoFi online portal, and it still showed my employment verification was missing. It had an option in the portal to upload an employment verification document. In the interest of thoroughness and redundancy, I requested a third employment verification from my employer, but this time I requested the document be sent directly to me. I received the document and the password, un-encrypted the document, and re-saved it. I then uploaded the un-encrypted document to the SoFi portal about XXXX XXXX, on XXXX/XXXX/16. Since that time, SoFi apparently has no record of receiving the previous two employment verification documents directly from my employer, nor a record of the SoFi employee I spoke with who verified the second employment verification. They have stated the document I provided is not sufficient because it did not come from my employer, and have requested yet another employment verification from my employer. Seeing as I have had my employer send two previous employment verification documents directly to them, I have refused to have my employer send them an employment verification a third time. SoFi \\'s lack of record-keeping and document accountability is alarming to me. I have provided them a lot of personally identifiable information ( PII ). How secure is the rest of that information if they ca n\\'t locate the previous two employment verification documents my employer sent them? I suspect there must be a standard financial institutions are required to adhere to in maintaining customer \\'s PII. I am concerned that SoFi does not have a practice of adhering to those standards. We have withdrawn our application from SoFi due to their poor record-keeping practices and insistence that I have my employer send them a third employment verification, but felt it prudent to file a complaint in the interest of all of their clients PII.',\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'XX/XX/XXXX This is a follow up to complaint number XXXX. \\nThe response from SOFI and XXXX  has created more questions than will fit in a 100 word limit response. \\n\\nXXXX  : Was all the generous detailed instruction on how to read my \" personal credit report \\'\\' simply lip service to deceive the CFPB regulators that monitor this complaint process? \\nYou may have set a new low! I have spent 15 months requesting what is guaranteed to me by section 609 of the FCRA. At this point there must be a dozen requests via direct letters to you, the CFPB complaint process and multiple requests by the Office of the Attorney General West Virginia ( who you would not even respond to multiple requests ). As I said before you have refused to answer, stonewalled or have given evasive replies that have nothing to do with the request. In your last complaint response, how generous it was of you to provide such detailed instruction regarding my personal credit report. Things like inquiries shared with others and inquiries shared only with you. And the mention by federal law, your personal credit report must list all organizations that have requested you credit history. And now the big new low -- -you never sent my personal credit report to me. Was all the generous detailed instruction simply lip service to the CFPB regulators that monitor this complaint process? With your 15 month track record with me it would be foolish for anyone to give you the benefit of the doubt. Your response was written in complete bad faith. Just like in the past 15 months you had no intention of delivering my consumer disclosure and fulfilling your obligation as a CRA. It certainly appears you think you are above the law. \\nThis is all I want. A simple one word response on the CFPB, sent. At which time you send me my consumer disclosure meaning the long version of my file, the one only I can request, that list every inquiry on my file including promotional inquiries as well as all information that has been suppressed or edited/deleted for whatever reason. Considering you are footnoted in this definition on XXXX you know exactly what I want. This consumer disclosure will also be back dated to a previous request, complaint number XXXX, filed XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nSOFI : My letter to you dated XX/XX/XXXX indicated that I had 30 SOFI pulls on my XXXX  report. Your XXXX XXXX letter indicated your investigation could only \" ... identified three soft pulls. \\'\\' XX/XX/XXXX, you said in a company response : If you are seeing as many as XXXX soft credit inquiries on your credit, please contact XXXX  regarding these inquires. What you are telling me? Could you not find these 27 pulls in your file or were you not expecting them to be listed on my regular XXXX  credit report? What is the reason the pulls showed up on the report if that is the case? Your response on XX/XX/XXXX these 27 pulls that were unaccounted for have now have magically become prescreen mailer pulls. Obviously, prescreen mailers come with the legal record keeping and firm offer obligations under the FCRA. It appears you didnt have a record of these 27 pulls your XXXX XXXX response which is most likely the reason I never received offers/mailers from you. Also, pre-screen offers are designed as a cost effective way to market to consumers that meet whatever thresholds. SOFI must buy millions of names from the CRAs annually. To think that SOFI does a soft credit check on each name every time a mailer is sent would negate any cost efficiency and to think that each consumer would get a soft pull every mailer that would show on their report would result in a huge number of complaints. SOFI does not have a lot of complaints. So what happened?? \\nHere are a couple of questions from your previous complaint response. \\nFirst, when asked how you obtained my social security number you indicated it was not necessary for pulls? That being the case, your own website indicates in the absence of a social security number consent is required : Website : \" Did you know that a company can pull your credit information with just your name, address, date of birth, and consent? \\'\\' Could you please elaborate as to when, where, and who did you obtain my consent? I expect that the consent requirements are different between the XXXX separate soft pulls and the prescreen pulls discussed above. Please itemize. \\nSecond, you stated we began sending you direct mailers in XX/XX/XXXX. This is shortly after the XXXX  data breach which I responded to with the security freeze/opted out. Were you accessing my data through XXXX  prior to XX/XX/XXXX? If so when did it start, how many pulls and what are the details of my consent? \\nThird, as discussed, there are several ways the prescreen process works. The most common is the CRA provides the list. The other way is the creditor provides the consumers name to the CRA. Considering the date of the first mailer, did you migrate my name to XXXX  because you could no longer access my data through XXXX?\\n\\nFourth, like I said before, I do not recall receiving a single mailer from you in the past three years. And considering the XXXX  report indicates that these were sometimes sent twice a month SOFI should be a household name around here. As you know the FCRA requires a firm offer as well as record keeping. This being the case could you please tell what you were marketing to me? XXXX  tells me these 27 pulls were preapprovals. There seems to be a big difference between a mortgage preapproval and a credit card preapproval. You mention the word \" loan \\'\\' in previous correspondance, was someone indicating I was interested in a loan and providing you with my consent? \\n\\nI look forward to you response. \\nSincerely, XXXX',\n",

In all that time, this program was always referred to as an income-based payment program, and I was never informed of any limitations on how long I could take advantage of it. In 2015, SoFi changed their servicer from XXXX to XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX I was informed that my payments would be effectively doubling within the next billing period. When I asked why I had not been provided with IBR paperwork, the servicer informed me that no such program existed. After several phone calls with SoFi over the course of two weeks, I finally learned that SoFi had not, in fact, had me on an IBR plan but on an interest-only forbearance. This was despite the fact that this was never communicated to me in correspondence or writing.

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'On XX/XX/2022, I applied for a XXXX XXXX XXXX ( # XXXX ) with Sofi for {$90000.00}, which initiated a hard inquiry. The stated rate at this point was 3.695 %. At that point, I was prompted for additional information, which I was not immediately able to provide. \\n\\nPrior to the 30-day window ending, I called Sofi in XX/XX/2022 to inquire about my application \\'s deadline. At that point, a service representative told me not to worry ; she stated that I had until XX/XX/2022 to submit the requested information, which would keep my offer valid. \\n\\nFast forward to the week of XX/XX/2022, and I submitted all of the requested information to complete my loan. This included my submission of paystubs, an income statement, and information pertaining to the loans I wished to refinance. Upon submission, I was prompted for a second hard inquiry, which caught me by surprise. As a result, I called Sofi \\'s customer service once more. \\nDuring this phone call, another Sofi representative told me that my original credit inquiry needed to be updated, since 30 days had lapsed. I informed him about the previous phone call I had, but he insisted that a second credit pull was unavoidable. He did, however, assure me that Sofi would honor the original rate of 3.695 %, despite a second hard inquiry credit pull. As a result, I pulled credit.\\n\\nShortly thereafter, I noticed that my offer changed on my Sofi portal. The new offer was for {$66000.00} at 5.465 %. This irked me, since I had recently checked my credit score from all three credit bureaus and saw that my scores had not changed from my previous credit score in XX/XX/2022. The new rate was also nearly two percentage points higher, which was not in line with with the previous representatives statement that \" Sofi would honor the original offer. \\'\\' This prompted yet another phone call to Sofi on XX/XX/2022. After communicating the above events, waiting for nearly an hour, and speaking with a manager, I was told that even though Sofi acknowledged that I had received \" miscommunication \\'\\' from its representatives, there was nothing Sofi could do to honor the original offer that I received. Frankly, I was told that I have to go forward with the new offer or take nothing. Additionally, Sofi could offer me no assurances that the hard credit inquiries I was hit with could be retracted. It truly felt like a bait and switch scheme.\\n\\nI want to express that I am very concerned with the above events. Altogether, I acted on information and assurances provided to me by Sofi representatives, and- in the end - I was penalized for it. Not only was I misinformed by the offer that was populating on my Sofi portal, but I was also misinformed by two unique Sofi service representatives at different points in time ; both led me to believe that I had ample time to finish providing additional information and that my original offer was still valid. In the end, I ended up with nothing but two hard inquiries that will ding my credit score, student loan debt at my existing rate, and a terrible consumer experience. What Sofi has done should not be legal. It it very unethical, and such practices negatively impact the financial well-being of consumers everywhere.',\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'A very large company XXXX SoFi XXXX that refinances student loans is undoubtedly engaged in deceptive and predatory lending practices. I know this because I used them to refinance my student loans recently. They advertise interest rates that would clearly be interpreted by any reasonable person as annualized rates and even call the interest rates \" Annual Percentage Rates \\'\\' in the loan documents but they actually compound this rate on a daily basis, making the effective annualized rate significantly higher than that which is being advertised. I carefully reviewed the loan documents I received and only in one place, buried deep in the disclosure, does it say interest is accrued on a daily basis, and even that description is confusing because it fails to disclose that the actual interest rate a borrower will pay on an annual basis is higher than the \" Annual Percentage Rate \\'\\' because of the daily compounding of interest ( which I think is a very material omission ). I genuinely believe SoFi is secretly robbing indebted students of XXXX dollars PER STUDENT by engaging in these predatory tactics and I believe action needs to be taken against them immediately. SoFi includes a well-crafted arbitration clause in their loan documents and the clause prohibits class arbitration, which effectively prevents any borrower from bringing a claim against them. I would be happy to represent myself against them, and luckily the agreement states each party pays its own legal expenses unless a claim is frivolous, but the fees of the arbitrators would quickly dwarf the amount at issue in my individual case, WHICH IS WHY I NEED YOUR HELP. You are the only available remedy for these kinds of shameful, predatory tactics. SoFi is a HUGE ORGANIZATION and the effect of taking action against them would benefit XXXX students. You have the ability to do a lot of good here ; please do n\\'t just let it pass you by. This is wrong, legally and morally, and you should do something about it. If you agree to pay my share of the arbitrators \\' fees I would be happy to take up this cause myself and set a precedent against them ( though decisions in arbitration are n\\'t binding, it would still look very very bad for them and may encourage changes to their practices ) but I am not going out of pocket XXXX dollars more than I already am out of pocket because of these shady practices ; I really ca n\\'t afford that.',\n",

They promised me twice that I would not have a 30 day derogatory on my credit report and they will not lift the 30 day late. \\nI do not have any denial letter from them as they have not provided me anything in writing. I have tried desperately to ensure that my credit was not \" dinged \\'\\' and called Sofi IMMEDIATELY to keep my payments current and on time. Sofi refuses to fix the problem they advised me they would fix and lied to me. I am now seeking the help of the Federal Government to help me as the institution will not. \\n\\n\\n\\nHello XXXX - Needless to say this has now wound up with you. I will be contacting the CFPB if I do not receive a satisfactory response from someone at your firm with regards to my credit being corrected. \\n\\nHere is my story. \\nIn XX/XX/XXXX, I called to advise you of a payment that would bounce on my account. I had received notice on my side but on your side it did not show yet. I wanted to make a payment as soon as possible in order to avoid a 30 day late. \\nI made my payment over the phone as promised. When I called to make this payment, the associate said that if I made the payment that day I would avoid any kind of 30 day late ( you can pull the call recording ). \\n\\nLast week I pulled a copy of my credit report and noticed that my credit was reflecting a 30 day late. I was told that this would not happen, so I immediately called you all. \\n\\nI spoke with a man ( unfortunately I did not get his name ) who advised me that the issue would be resolved and that my credit would be fixed so as to not have a 30 day late on my credit report. He advised me that he would send me an email advising me of the correction. \\n\\nSince then, I have not received an email or phone call of any resolution from Sofi. \\nI then decided to email you all for status. The first email I received from XXXX told me to contact XXXX. Dead end. Ironially - I did file a dispute with all XXXX credit bureaus who advised me that the error would not be corrected. \\nThe second email I received from XXXX stated that they were unable to locate my account and to email from the email address on file, which I then did for my 3rd email. The email I received from XXXX stated that the record was \" true \\'\\' and that I could call you to discuss. \\n\\nI called yesterday to follow up and was on hold for about 20 minutes before I was disconnected. I called back and asked for a return call and the associate called but did not leave a message. \\nToday I called and was on hold for another 20 minutes before the associate advised me that they did not have anyone available ( for another 20 minutes ) and that they would call me back. \\n\\nNeedless to say this is an absolute headache. All I want is my credit fixed as promised. It appears no one wants to read notes to abide by what was promised to me. I made my payments on time and have done my part to always ensure that I am in good standing with you. I wish I could just get that in return. \\n\\nAgain, next stop will be CFPB if the response I receive is insufficient. The funny part about all this is that I was initially very impressed with your customer service. My husband and I are starting to shop around for a 1st mortgage and I considered contacting you all. After this experience, I will not be doing that. \\n\\nXXXX XXXX',\n",

Again, no response from him but a contact from his consumer relations department saying they could not give me the real reason the loan was turned down over the phone but she could send me the credit report that violated their terms and conditions. These terms and conditions were never explained to me or listed anywhere on their website or advertising. \\n\\nThis has caused me to again search for a personal loan from other companies and put another inquiry on my credit report for pursuing a loan so the next company can say to many credit inquiries as a reason for turning down a possible loan. Plus has set back the timing of consolidating my resolving credit situation costing me $ $ 's in interest at the higher rates. \\n\\nI believe their methods are very deceiving to the consumer and practices of asking for communication with the CEO are also a deceptive practice when he never really sees the complaint or addresses the issue even though it is promoted that you will communicate directly with him and they use his personal email as the communication point. \\n\\nI would classify this lender as a buyer beware company because they are not upfront with their practices and lending criteria.

There are no one support channels to speak to someone directly about this freeze. They all say to call this phone number which has no person on the other end.

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'Hello, Over the past 12 months I have filed many disputes/complaints with XXXX and SoFi simply requesting information that is guaranteed to me by the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Section 609 of the FCRA -- -Section 1 -- - \\'\\' All the information in the consumers file ... \\'\\' and which would include the \" ... Identification of each person ( including each end user ). \\n\\nInstead, XXXX and SoFi have refused to answer, stonewalled, or have given evasive replies that have nothing to do with the simple request. XXXX has gone as far as to completely ignore and not respond to requests by the Attorney General of West Virginia. \\n\\nHere is a timeline : XX/XX/XXXX CFPB number XXXX -- -I stated, \" I\\'ve contacted XXXX via telephone multiple times, and they do not offer a way to request my credit report going back 6 years ... \\'\\' XX/XX/XXXX XXXX responded \" Once we receive your complete identification information, we will promptly address you complaint \\'\\' and closed the complaint. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX I sent a letter requesting my credit record with pulls \" as far back as possible or at least the 6 years as required by law. This was accompanied with the required identification. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX I get another letter from XXXX requesting identification. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX I sent a third request along with the necessary identification. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX I get another letter from XXXX requesting identification. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX I send another letter to XXXX stating : Sirs, You indicate we were unable to honor your request or a portion of based on the limited amount of information regarding your dispute but they do not say what information is necessary for you to complete your legal obligation to provide a complete history of my hard and soft credit pulls. \\n\\nPer your instructions on my last request you were provided a copy of my drivers license and a utility bill. This time I have included a copy of my drivers license and my United States passport. Also, instead of just one copy of a utility bill I have provided 4. \\nAt your convenience please provide a complete history of my hard and soft credit pulls. \\n\\nMy address for the last 20 years has been XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, WV XXXX. My social security number is XXXX and my DOB is XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX I receive a letter from XXXX which once again fails to address the issue but is a simple credit report. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX I file a complaint with the State of West Virginia Attorney General. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX I receive a letter from XXXX XXXX at the West Virginia Attorney General indicating they have contacted XXXX on several occasions and have not received a response. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX I file another complaint with the CFPB number XXXX indicating that XXXX \" continues to provide my financial data to parties that do not have legitimate purpose ... \\'\\' XX/XX/XXXX XXXX replies \" ... you are requesting the inquires to be deleted ... \\'\\' This was never requested! \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX I send the following request to SoFi. Please keep in mind, I do not meet the marketing profile of SoFi and I have never received any solicitation from them in spite of the 30 times they have used my data from XXXX. \\n\\nHello, Your company, Sofi Lending Corp. has pulled my credit report at least 30 occasions in the past 3-4 years using the XXXX CRA. Your representative on XXXX indicated this might be as the result of a marketing campaign though I have never received anything from your company. \\n\\nAt your convenience and as required by the Fair Credit Reporting Act, section 607 please identify each end user of the resold report ( information ). And for what legitimate purpose is my credit report being used for as required by section 604? \\n\\nEnclosed is a copy of my Drivers License and two utility bills. My social security number is XXXX. \\n\\nYou may contact me by email at XXXX or call me at XXXX. \\n\\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX SoFi responded : \" We are unable to locate any record of your name at the address provided. \\'\\' I have lived here for almost 30 years and they have accessed my data at XXXX 30 times in 36 months. Stonewalled again! And they go on to say they have removed me from their direct mailing list \" ..though I may receive one or two more due to mail lead times ... \\'\\' Considering I have never received any mail from SoFi I doubt that will happen. \\nAnd obviously I did not make the request to be removed. \\n\\n\\nSo, this is what I want, it is simple, which is quoted directly from the Act itself : 609. Disclosures to consumers [ 15 U.S.C. 1681g ] ( a ) Information on file ; sources ; report recipients. Every consumer reporting agency shall, upon request, and subject to 610 ( a ) ( 1 ) [ 1681h ], clearly and accurately disclose to the consumer : ( 1 ) All information in the consumers file at the time of the request The initial request was XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nAnd from the date of the initial request and to what legitimate purpose is the use of the report : ( 3 ) ( A ) Identification of each person ( including each end-user identified under section 607 ( e ) ( 1 ) [ 1681e ] ) that procured a consumer report ( i ) for employment purposes, during the 2-year period preceding the date on which the request is made ; or ( ii ) for any other purpose, during the 1-year period preceding the date on which the request is made. \\n\\nMy identifications are uploaded. \\n\\nAny questions plz dont hesitate, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX',\n",

The problem is following:\\n\\nOnXX/XX/XXXX, I made a transaction with XXXX XXXX XXXX for $XXXX (Transaction ID: XXXX). However, I never received the order. I tried to contact XXXX XXXX XXXX but can not solve the problem. I made a dispute with SOFI. Since its a credit card, I should not be liable for this type of charge. However, SOFI never get back to me. The dispute claim number is XXXX. The representative who handle it is XXXX  ext XXXX. 2 weeks after initiate the dispute and dont see any confirmation from SOFI, I called back in to customer service and they advised that the dispute is closed because they need more information from me. To be specific, they want to know how much for each pallet of flooring that I ordered. But in reality, I never receive a call, email or mail. They denied, and closed my claim without my acknowledgement and proper reason. I told the customer service agent that I can give them that info so they can keep disputing it for me. The agent gave me XXXX  contact and also ask XXXX  to get back to me. When I call XXXX, even during business hour, it always goes to voicemail. I left her 2 voicemails (10 days apart). She never answered to those voicemails. I tried to call back in and tried to leave more voicemails but the voicemails box of SOFI Dispute department is full so I cant do anything. I tried to call back to customer service and have been talking to many different operators. They all gave me the same information that they will contact the Dispute team and escalate it on my behalf and I should hear back with in 48 hours. It has been months and I dont hear anything back. The operators ID are: XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. In the meanwhile, Im charged for interest on the purchase, and my credit score is going down because of the higher credit utilization. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I filed a complaint with the XXXX (XXXX XXXX XXXX), and quickly after that, SOFI responded to me. They promised to work on the claim. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, they sent me a letter in the mail saying that the dispute is resolved in my favor and the credit is now permanent.\\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, There is a charge from XXXX XXXX XXXX on my account (Transaction ID: XXXX) for $XXXX (exactly the same as the charge before).\\n\\nSince that time, I tried to contact SOFI many time by email, and phone call, but there is no luck, they are not reachable.\\n\\nPlease help me solving this problem.',\n",

I am including evidence about why I can't re apply for pre approval at XXXX XXXX XXXX, their division, no matter their emails keep arriving constantly to my XXXX account recently. Do not know if XXXX XXXX considers this evidence. It was sent through here so it can arrive faster, and for them to see, if they assign a person not a machine to evaluate, that the Fair Credit Reporting Act violations are allowed, as well as Fair Debt Collection Practices Act violations, and nobody does anything about it : SoFi XXXX  does not provide a space under their pre approval form with no penalty to credit score that I submitted today XX/XX/XXXX, and was denied because as shown in their online provided document, a serious delinquency appears, no matter the evidence I included even up to the Supreme Court shows all that is false, but no matter, no one did anything at any level, credit bureaus, the same Banks XXXX and XXXX XXXX, I have to say also the C.F.P.B., which has resources to face this Banks better at the Federal Courts when there are violations to the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. I ask SoFi to put someone, not a machine, to evaluate all this evidence : A summary could be this : Have you ever heard of 2 main banks presenting themselves as a collection agency at the 3 credit bureaus? Have you ever heard of 2 accounts paid only and directly to the original bank, been reported as failed to pay, loss, and on a collection agency, when all that is false? Have you ever heard on main bank reporting a certified payment agreement for a credit card with them, paid directly to them, to the original account number, never to a collection agency, and paid successfully as agreed for 48 months as the agreement has in writing, being reported as failed to pay, loss, collection, and even as of today, a credit report it still has remaining balance, after more extinguishing all procedures, starting with the same Bank, then the credit bureaus, then the CFPB, and then the 3 Federal Courts, but no one did anything? Have you ever heard of a main bank prohibiting a client to continue to pay a personal loan after it was fully updated directly with the same Bank, never to a collection agency, after years it was fully updated and paid as agreed for years after updated, in order to keep reporting without never updating the credit report it was a loss and under collection no matter it is false? All this and more was taken as a last resource to the Supreme Court of the U.S. as well as the F.B.I. Corruption Division where frauds by Banks are also investigated, but nothing is happening : Only the pre approval denial like yours at SoFi continue.\",\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'I am a banking customer with this financial institution, and this is a complaint and report of improper and insufficient handling of a fraudulent transaction dispute. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I used my SoFi debit card to purchase a product online ( a bed frame, ) from a vendor \" XXXX XXXX \\'\\'. The transaction was successful and my account was charged in the amount of {$140.00}. Unfortunately, in the weeks that followed, it appeared quite obvious that I had become a victim of a scam. After not receiving a production on the expected time-frame, I reviewed my order and noticed several red flags : besides NOT receiving my product, the vendor \\'s website was offline, their \" customer support \\'\\' address was a private email address and, lastly, they had provided a fake tracking link. All of the above remains the case as of the date of this report. Anyone can verify this information as follows : The website address provided by the vendor : XXXX The XXXX  ( XXXX ) tracking number provided by the vendor : XXXX Therefore, I reported the fraudulent transaction to SoFi and opened a dispute via their customer service. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from the SoFi dispute department asking me to provide documentation of the above, and I did, and they claimed they would investigate. \\n\\nNearly two months later, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a followup email from SoFi, claiming that \" XXXX XXXX \\'\\' responded to them with a rebuttal to my claim, but SoFi refused to share the material that was supposedly supplied to them by the vendor. They said they they sent me an attachment, which I was unable to access. I called them the same day to complain about my inability to access the documentation, and they verbally explained that the vendor \\'s rebuttal consisted of them sending \" pictures of the product they sent \\'\\' ( as if that constituted a believable proof that the product was shipped???? ) and the customer support specialist admitted that this was a diversion tactic on the part of the vendor, but continued to refuse to give me access to this \" evidence \\'\\'. Instead, the support person vehemently insisted I reply to the email I received from SoFi and to state that I \" reject the rebuttal \\'\\' and when I continued to explain that I would - understandably - like to see WHAT evidence I am disagreeing with, they insisted I just reject. Even though I was visibly unhappy about the lack of proper customer support and I voiced my concern with my banking institution, I realized that they were giving me no choice, and that I had to disagree without seeing the evidence, if I wanted the investigation to continue. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, SoFi responded that they concluded nothing was wrong with the transaction and that they closed the investigation, in spite of it being obvious that they had not done their due diligence. They communicated that the investigation was closed, and offered no further assistance, including a possibility of an appeal. \\n\\nI immediately called them again, and I requested what was the extent of their research, and how could they credibly claim that this had been a legitimate transaction when they clearly had not conducted their research properly. Even just by accessing the information I provided above, it is clear that this vendor \\'s site continues to be offline, and that the tracking information indicates that the order has never been shipped, and therefore not delivered to my address either. As a matter of fact, SoFi customer support refused to substantiate their investigation in any way, only offering to send me a letter electronically, and I told them that this did not function in the past, and that I was owed an explanation. \\n\\nOnly after insisting and asking several times did the support specialist agree to escalate my complaint to a supervisor, by the name of XXXX XXXX. I revisited the details of the case with Mr XXXX, and he had promised that he would file an internal report and complaint about how this case had been handled by the bank, and also offered to send me the aforementioned evidence that ( supposedly ) had been sent to them by the fraudulent vendor. When I finally received that attachment later that day, it was simply a copy of my transaction that was provided by a third-party processor. Needless to say, it is evident and clearly verifiable from my bank account that I indeed paid for this item and that these funds were deducted from my account. That document was not only NOT the evidence SoFi had previously referred to verbally, it also did not it any way constitute a proof that this order had been fulfilled. \\n\\nI immediately complained about this by responded to Mr XXXX but have not received any communication from the bank since. \\n\\nIn closing, I am completely mortified by this banking institution utter lack of concern towards protecting their customer from fraudulent vendors. It was evident from all of my communication with the bank that they failed to conduct a proper investigation, and/or to supply any evidence of communication with the vendor as well as any proof of any research / investigation that they completed independently to determine that this was a legitimate transaction and that it had indeed been fulfilled as promised. \\n\\nTo this date, I have not been able to have any response from the vendor, as their website remains offline ( and, I suspect, will remain so indefinitely ) and the tracking information they provided in early XXXX, still appears inaccurate/ false on the shipper \\'s tracking website. \\n\\nIn doing so, SoFi is failing their customers. They are throwing us under the bus, while at the same time enabling bad actors to get away with fraud by failing to do their due diligence in properly investigating fraudulent transactions.',\n",

The reasons are unknown, because I need to submit a letter to them requesting them. This is very unfair, as I believe they should automatically tell me these reasons in an adverse action letter.\\n\\nThe company did a soft credit pull and put this information on the adverse action letter. The credit score there was lower than any score I\\'ve ever had ( I frequently check - my score is typically in the 720-750 range, and this was less than 700 ) and noted serious delinquency. When I looked at my free credit report, there was no indication of any delinquency at all. If this was a reason I got denied, then this is ridiculous since it is untrue.\\n\\nI did speak with someone when I originally applied, and they stated my working less than 2 years would be a reason for denial. I have worked a little over a year and a half because I graduated college two years ago and spent a semester in grad school. I found a job within weeks of leaving school, and was \" unemployed \\'\\' for less than 2 months. I don\\'t understand how a company that works to refinance student loans can penalize an applicant for working less time because the time up to when I started working was made up of me attending college, which is why I have the loans in the first place.

Both payments were processed, posted and confirmations were received ( see below ) ). \\nI then proceeded to close the loan. However, I found that SoFi only applied partial payment to principal, charged me {$170.00} interest fee and then re-amortized the loan. I received a new email on XX/XX/XXXX that my regular payment did not clear due to insufficient funds ( even though I received a text, email and account notifications that stated BOTH payments posted )?! \\nI called on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to the manager, XXXX regarding this matter. I requested that the {$170.00} be credited and applied as it was requested to principal only. He stated no, that is how they do it. This made no sense since I specifically asked if there were any pre-payment penalties before I agreed to the loan. I requested that my accounts be closed immediately. I made direct payoff payments to him. \\nAs of today XX/XX/XXXX, I went online and found that they again, re-amortized the loan causing me a new balance owed of {$.00}.

I used to have a brokerage account called \" SoFi Money, \\'\\' but not their new Checking and Savings account. \\n\\nPer the terms and conditions I was given on XX/XX/XXXX : \" Eligible Participants : All new members who open a SoFi Checking and Savings account during the Promotion Period and all existing SoFi Checkings and Savings customers who have not previously set up Direct Deposit transactions ( Direct Deposit ) into their SoFi Checking and Savings account as of the beginning of the Promotion Period are eligible for the Program. \\'\\' Please see page 7 of the attached pdf.\\n\\nI requested access to the new Checking and Savings account on XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nThe following day, XX/XX/XXXX, I logged into my SoFi account and was greeted with display offering this same {$300.00} bonus. I wanted to double check, so I spoke with SoFi \\'s chat support. A live agent named XXXX XXXX informed me that I was eligible. Please see jpg files 1 and 2. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I reached out again to SoFi chat support because I had expected the {$300.00} bonus to be deposited by then. A live agent named XXXX XXXX apologized that I hadn\\'t received the bonus yet, and said it would be awarded \" in a couple of days. \\'\\' On XX/XX/XXXX, I called SoFi by phone. I was informed that I was not eligible for this bonus, and that I had been misinformed. The agent I spoke to told me that it was their fault I had been misinformed, but the bonus would still not be awarded. I asked to speak to someone higher up. \\n\\nI then spoke to XXXX XXXX. She told that direct deposit activity on my old \" SoFi Money \\'\\' brokerage account disqualified me from earning this bonus. I pointed out that there was no such language in the terms and conditions that I accepted. She said that there was language specifically excluding customers like me on their website now, and that they reserve the right to change terms and conditions at any time. \\n\\nI pointed out that this was unfair. I reminded her that they admitted this was a mistake on their part. I also pointed out that \" changing the terms and conditions at any time \\'\\' would allow them to refuse the promised bonus to any customer at any time. Ultimately, XXXX and I could not come to resolution. \\n\\nI feel like this is a bait and switch. I did my due diligence, I followed the rules as presented to me when I accepted their offer, and I verified multiple times that I was eligible for the promotion. It\\'s only after I deposited three consecutive paychecks ( and bolstered their balance sheet for investors ) that they now say they changed the rules and I don\\'t qualify for the bonus.',\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'I opened a SOFI checking account on XX/XX/22 to take advantage of the {$300.00} account opening bonus for completing a direct deposit of $ XXXX. The first $ XXXX direct deposit occurred on XX/XX/22 and per the terms and conditions the {$300.00} bonus would be paid out within 14 business days or XX/XX/22. As of XX/XX/22, the bonus had yet to be paid out. Additionally, SOFI was having a subsequent account referral bonus promotion occurring where if a family member or friend opened a SOFI checking account and deposited at least {$10.00} within 5 days, they would receive a {$25.00} bonus and the person who referred the new account owner would receive {$50.00} within 10 business days. I emailed my wife my referral link on XX/XX/22 and she opened her account the same day using my referral link and deposited {$10.00} into the new account. As of XX/XX/22, no referral bonuses have been received by the account holders. On XX/XX/22, I emailed SOFI customer service to inquire about all 3 bonuses and I received a response stating the {$300.00} bonus would be paid within 2 weeks and there was no record of a referral link being used. I responded to SOFI \\'s response but never received a response. I sent a follow-up email to SOFI on XX/XX/22 and as of XX/XX/22 have not received a response. I called SOFI customer service on XX/XX/22 to check the status of all 3 bonuses at XXXX XXXX CT, and an exception request was submitted for the {$300.00} bonus after the customer service agent stated that sometimes SOFI \\'s waits 30 days to send the bonus even though their Terms and Conditions state it will be paid within 14 business days. After rectifying the {$300.00} bonus, I inquired about the referral bonus status. I was again told there is no record of my referral link being used even though I have a record of emailing my link to my wife and watching her open the account with my referral link. After I explained this to the SOFI customer service representative, she stated that SOFI recently went through a system update to fix a \" glitch or a bug \\'\\' in the system so the referral links would now work and their systems would recognize when the referral links are being used. She also stated it is likely the known bug existed when I sent the referral link to my wife and other customers experienced this issue. When I explained my UDAAP concerns and asked to open a formal complaint, I requested my call be escalated to a manager. I was transferred to a XXXX XXXX who stated this was a known issue and he received similar complaints from customers, but there was nothing he could do per the Terms and Conditions. I asked to escalate to another manager, but he said there was no one else to escalate to. I finished my call at XXXX XXXX  CT after explaining I would file a complaint with the CFPB. My concern is that this is a known issue with SOFI and their are using deceptive acts to have customers open accounts and are not meeting the terms of the referral bonus because of a bug in their systems. Their Terms and Conditions should be considered null and void after I met the conditions of the referral bonus but their system glitch prevents SOFI from recognizing the referral link was used. I look forward to a resolution or participation in any class action lawsuit.',\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'I need help getting my money back from a company that\\'s called Social Financing Corporation known as ( Sofi ). I was locked out of my account for suspicious activity ( which they stated ) Lies. There was nothing going on with my account. I opened my account in the middle of XX/XX/XXXX and I was locked out of my account on XX/XX/XXXX. I was sent email and was told to call the fraud department to get this issue resolved. I called the fraud department and left a message for them to contact me back. Someone called me 48 hours later and that was on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX was the rep that was over my account and he was apart of the Fraud Department team ( XXXX ) XXXX. As I am speaking with him he asked me to provide the names and number and address to the people who was sending me money and I did that. He begins to get frustrated and he started using profanity. I had no idea what was going on with him. I was soooooo upset. I hung up and called the customer service number ( XXXX ) XXXX and told them exactly what happened during that conversation and they were able to hear the recorded phone call as well. I filed a complaint against XXXX XXXX and they reassigned my account to someone else. Since that day I called them over and over again trying to get in touch with the person who is over my account XXXX. I called customer service and told them what was going on and they said that they had been calling me but I placed them on the do not call list. I do not do that at all. I am trying to resolve this issue but they\\'re lying. Side bar ( I read so many complaints on the XXXX  website and some consumers stated that Sofi stated they tried calling to leave them a message but they were placed on the \" Do Not Call List. \\'\\' They did that when I filed my complaint against XXXX XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I finally received a phone call from XXXX who is apart of the Fraud Department team. He asked me to verify who I was so he sent over a text and I had to click on a link to show my face and my ID that showed my name and address. I gave them my social that was also on file and he stated that is all that he needed to verify who I was. After that I haven\\'t heard anything from him. I was calling at least 2-3 times a week leaving messages, and sending out emails with the same lame response from them. I am fed up and I mean fed up. I was calling them XX/XX/XXXX ( 3x ) XX/XX/XXXX ( 2x ), XX/XX/XXXX ( 1 ), XX/XX/XXXX ( 1 ), XX/XX/XXXX ( 4x ) On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX I was fed up with this company. I called the Fraud Department and left a message and said \" I need someone to call me back asap because I am getting so sick and tired of calling and leaving messages and no one calls me back. I will file a lawsuit against this company. ) Someone called me from ( XXXX ) XXXX This man calls me and says \" Hi this is blank ( forgot his name ) from the Fraud Department the only person that needs to cops called on is you. You were not the one that opened the account this is not your account. \\'\\' I was so angry and upset. I called and filed a complaint against that man. He called me from a different number other than the number that are on file for Sofi. I was livid. I filed a complaint and still nothing has been done. I\\'ve called so many times in XXXX and in XXXX I stopped keeping track. I filed so many complaints and spoke with account specialist and they give me the same response. I told them if there was an issue with the deposit reverse the transaction so the sender can send me the money another way. I spoke with the sender and she stated that Sofi called her and she verified her identity and they also locked her out of her Sofi Money Market account. I am over this! They could reverse the transaction and close my account, close the account and send me the check or send the sender the check, or reopen the account. But no they refuse to do anything. The account wasn\\'t even open for 2 months and they have a 6 month investigation going on. I called again today XX/XX/XXXX 2 times and still no answer besides \" The fraud department is still doing an investigation and will update you when they\\'re done. \\'\\' I need help they\\'re holding my funds hostage and I want it back now. Please help me because this company has so many complaints online and over 400 with the XXXX  please help!',\n",

I have placed alerts on all three bureaus. Furthermore, XXXX has made it their policy to never talk to a customer unless they are a business customer. Their automated system menus are deliberately designed to lead callers to dead-ends and hang up on them. They dont take their duty as to the public as a credit reporting agency seriously and are not even willing to fulfill the basics steps to protect the identity of the people whose information they sell. I have not been able to get a response from them or Sofi at this point. I am purely depending on credit locks and freezes and my personal diligence to protect my finances. The hard inquiry on my credit still remains. Luckily, I dont believe any loans were generated as I reacted within minutes.',\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'I contacted SoFi regarding an advertised Student loan rate of 1.91 %. \\n\\nI was really excited to see SoFi \\'s advertise 1.91 % on student loan \\'s and went through the registration and application process immediately. Sadly the \" best \\'\\' rate thy were able to over me was 3.825 % on a variable 5 year loan. \\n\\nI took a screen shot of the advertisement XXXX The rate quote did n\\'t pull credit score which I was surprised about but I know my credit is really high. Since they did n\\'t pull a credit score, I also went through and try numerous permutations of of the rate quote matrix to try and see what did land the 1.91 % percent but never got below 3.825 %. \\n\\nAfter that I decided to email SoFi and see if they could answer what it takes to get that rate. \\n\\nSo I wrote them : Hi SoFi, I am trying to learn how to obtain the 1.91 % APR you \\'ve listed : Currently when I go through the Find My Rate page, I only see 3.825 % as my lowest option. For footnote # 1, you do n\\'t spell out anything regarding the credit worthiness of the borrower : Fixed rates from 3.50 % APR ( with AutoPay ) to 7.49 % APR ( without AutoPay ). Variable rates currently from 1.91 % APR ( with AutoPay ) to 5.45 % ( without AutoPay ). Interest rates on variable rate loans are capped at either 8.95 % or 9.95 % depending on term of loan. See APR examples and terms. Lowest variable rate of 1.91 % APR assumes current 1 month XXXX rate of 0.20 % plus 1.71 % margin. If approved for a loan, the fixed or variable interest rate offered will depend on your credit history and the term of the loan and will be within the ranges of rates listed above. For the SoFi variable rate loan, the 1-month XXXX index will adjust monthly and the loan payment will be re-amortized and may change monthly. APRs for variable rate loans may increase after origination if the XXXX index increases. The SoFi 0.25 % AutoPay interest rate reduction requires you to agree to make monthly principal and interest payments by an automatic monthly deduction from a savings or checking account. The benefit will discontinue and be lost for periods in which you do not pay by automatic deduction from a savings or checking account. \\n\\nAPR examples and terms also does not spell out the criteria needed to qualify for such a rate. I ask because I feel like I \\'m an ideal candidate for such a low rate, my debt-to-income is less than 10 %, I \\'ve been at my job for more than 10 years and my credit score is very high. \\n\\nTheir response Thank you for your email. The 1.90 % rate is for our 5 year variable term. SoFi considers a variety of factors based on your personal circumstances at the time of application. When making a decision about your application & resulting terms and conditions we consider, but are not limited to your : -credit profile -total gross income -years of work experience -debt burden capacity analysis My response : Hi XXXX, Credit profile is n\\'t pulled when I go through your rate finder so I do n\\'t see how this is possibly a variable when quoting. \\nTotal gross income - How much? \\nI have the maximum years work experience selected ( XXXX ) My debt burden analysis, or my debt-to-income as most financial institutions call it is less than 10 %. \\n\\nI want the 1.90 % but I \\'m looking for specifics regarding what it takes to get it, so far it \\'s very ambiguous - please advise. \\n\\nTheir response In order for you to receive your preapproval rates, Sofi performs a soft credit check, which does not affect your credit but does give insight into your credit history. As far as the other factors that are taken into account when deciding your rate, we do not provide any more specifics as they are part of our underwriting criteria which we do not disclose.

SOFI requested my tax returns, since I am self employed, for XXXX and XXXX which I provided. Then they requested all of the schedules that I did not have. I called to ask which schedules, for personal or business returns, and the lady I spoke to said that since I received paystubs from my business, that I could just submit those for approval. I submitted my last XXXX paystubs by uploading them to SOFI and I called back to make sure they were received. Now a new rep said that I still needed to submit the schedules for the tax returns, even after I had been told that my paystubs would be fine. I called SOFI today and XXXX, another rep, said that they were still looking for schedules. I then spoke to her manager XXXX XXXX, and he refused to speak to my accountant that was on the line with me and was trying to see what schedules they wanted. This company is terrible in its customer service and lies to consumers about what is required for loan approval. The reps are not properly trained and tell you different things about the requirements because they are just reading off of the software for the client file but do not really know what is happening with files. The process is misleading and every person you talk to tells you something different. I have wasted a lot of time and I have been unable to consolidate my credit cards which are at very high rates.

       "   'complaint_what_happened': \"On XX/XX/2022, after 2 failed deposits in different amounts and 1 failed accidentally scheduled a deposit for {$1.00} my account was frozen, and my stock positions sold for a loss. I have called and called the number provided in the message that states the account it frozen. The number goes straight to voice-mail and I've left several messages. On XX/XX/2022 I called every number on the company website until I was finally able to speak to someone. They informed me that my account was frozen and I would have to wait for the risk team to sort it out and I was promised an email decision by the end of the day. XXXX I called again and was informed the account was frozen for 60 days. At this time i.also discovered my stock positions had been liquidated at a loss although my account balance was well above zero before the sale. On XXXX I called again, asking for a reinstatement of my positions or the ability to move my money out. I was informed again that the account was frozen and I wouldn't be receiving my gains previously made, just my initial deposit of {$960.00}, and not for 62 days, vs 60 I was told the day before. There is no reason my account should remain frozen, especially for 60-62 days. They also asked me to lie to my depositing bank and claim.i hadn't sent the {$960.00} in order to speed up the process of the return. I will not lie to my bank, nor will I lose the {$400.00} in gains that I made using the {$960.00}. My frozen account balance is {$1300.00}, and I shouldn't have to wait 2 months and/or lose {$400.00} because of a simple error in depositing funds.I 've cost no one any money, I've done nothing illegal, and I don't feel that selling my positions without my.permission is fair. The sale of all stocks resulted in {$190.00} in losses at the time, and untouched until present would have been a far greater amount of gains, costing me even more. I have begged, pleaded, and threatened legal action to no avail. Simply put, Sofi had stolen {$400.00}, locked up {$960.00}, and cost me and additional {$190.00} in just one day of unwarranted actions. In 62 days my {$960.00} is.supposed to be returned but I received a message today from SoFi explaining that it will take up to 180 days. The potential loss is exponential in 6 months time. I want my money, XXXX {$1500.00} returned to me immediately by check or as a transfer to another trading platform. I shouldn't have to wait 6 months for only a percentage of my money to be returned. I saved for a long time to have this money to invest since I don't have a retirement plan. This sets me back 6 months, but likely.much much longer. Stocks are at historic lows making for a.great opportunity that I'm getting robbed of because SoFi doesn't want to release my funds back to me or allow me to transfer my small investment to another brokerage.\",\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'About nine months ago I applied for a student loan consolidation with SoFi for approximately {$47000.00}. During the application process, I made it clear that I was under review by the Veterans Affairs for a XXXX XXXX. I specifically asked several times how my XXXX status from the Veterans Affairs would affect my loan and application. I also asked if it could be counted as income because I expected to be assessed at XXXX XXXX. Every time I asked him about my XXXX status, he changed the subject or reminded me that the longer I waited, the higher my rate would be. He kept saying it was a standard agreement. I was never once warned of the rights I was about to give up by turning my Federal Student Loan over to SoFi as a XXXX veteran. That should have been an immediate red flag for the representative to make me aware of that fact. They did, however, threaten me with an increased rate if I didnt make a decision quickly. I felt pressured and rushed to give them an answer. I was told about a month after signing the contract, as expected, I was assessed for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX by the XXXX XXXX. I am a XXXX XXXX XXXX, but now SoFi states that I have given up my rights to student loan forgiveness. \\n\\nAfter I received XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, I called SoFi to inquire about the process on how to apply for federal student loan forgiveness, they told me that I was ineligible. After several phone calls and denials, I reported them to the Better Business Bureau in XX/XX/XXXX. SoFi replied with this statement : The applicant applied for a Student Loan Refinance on XX/XX/XXXX, all necessary underwriting was completed by XX/XX/XXXX. SoFi placed a call to the applicant on XX/XX/XXXX advising his loan acceptance packet was ready to sign. When SoFi makes an outbound call to advise a loan is available to sign, the SoFi representative encourages the Applicant to review the document before signing. In section 3.C of the Loan Acceptance Document, the loss of loan forgiveness benefits is outlined. It identifies specific individuals as follows borrowers pursuing careers in Public Service, Teaching and/or the Armed Forces. As a private lending corporation, SoFi does not participate in Federal Loan Forgiveness programs. \\n\\nThey used the portion of the contract that stated borrowers pursuing careers in Public Service, Teaching and/or the Armed Forces. This did n\\'t pertain to me because it pertains to someone \" pursuing \\'\\' these professions. I completed my service to my country over 10 years before I applied for this refinancing and did n\\'t plan to pursue careers in Public Service, Teaching and/or the Armed Forces in the future. I now know why they used scare tactics and rushed me to sign. It is their practice to intice Veterans with low-interest rates and deny us of our rights once the contract is signed. They hide behind contract verbiage that does n\\'t pertain to Veterans whose service was honorably completed several years before applying for this loan. \\nIf I was not deceived and threatened by the salesman with losing the loan, I would have waited the 3 months that it took to get my decision from Veterans Affairs. I did not have any reason to rush refinancing my loan. \\nAs shown in the documentation attached you can see that my XXXX XXXX XXXX rating effective date was backdated to XX/XX/XXXX. This date is 4 months prior to applying for this loan.',\n",

I was looking to lower my rate and monthly payment on other personal loans I hold and looked at Sofi to see if I was eligible for additional funds to solve for this and was pre approved ( not pre qualified ) for a 60 month {$50000.00} loan at 8.587 %. I uploaded all of the necessary documents XXXX pay stubs, copy of driver \\'s license ) and submitted to underwriting. \\n\\nTo my surprise my application was denied due to \" poor credit performance with Sofi \\'\\'. I have had three loans with Sofi and never missed a payment. I have never missed a payment on any loan and have a credit score of XXXX. When I called to question why I was not approved, I was basically told that the decision was based on a black box calculation and because the customer service representatives are not loan originators, they could not help me. They said that if I were to apply to refinance my loan instead that I might have a better chance. I started a refinance application and was given another pre approval with a rate of 11.60 % on a 60 month loan. \\n\\nMy first issue is that I was pre approved for the loan and know that Sofi must have information regarding my credit history to give me that designation. My credit is clean and I have not taken on more debt since originating my last loan with Sofi. As a current loan holder and much of my information pre-populated, I was led to believe that Sofi already knew my credit history through a commonplace \" soft pull \\'\\'. How is it that I could be denied for \" poor credit performance with Sofi \\'\\' if I have never been late on a payment and am actually paying {$260.00} extra per month on my current loan. By misleading me that I was pre approved and allowing Sofi to run my credit, I have hurt my credit score and made it less likely that I will be approved by another lender. \\n\\nMy second issue is the discrepancy between the rates I was given for the loan I was denied and the refinancing rate. It seems to me that they are gouging me based on my current rate. Presumably they would have no further information on my credit history for this refinance application than they had on the loan I was declined for. While I understand the right of the company to price different products differently, this seems unethical at the least Thank you for your assistance in this matter',\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'Im becoming increasingly concerned with the servicing provided by XXXX for my loan originated with SoFi. In XXXX they raised my variable interest loan up to 7.18 % from 3.55 % the previous month. I notified them of the error and it was corrected down to 2.98 %. I didnt want to make a big stink about it going up XXXX % for a few days so I let that go after it was fixed. \\n\\nThen in XXXX I applied for an economic hardship ( XX/XX/20 ) forbearance as a result of medical bills I received. They sent me the form via e-mail & instructed me to return it via my dual authenticated account online. After I completed the form and uploaded it as instructed, they denied the claim without cause communicated to me. I reached out & they indicated said without an actual signature they couldnt approve it. I asked them for alternatives because I dont have a printer and didnt think it made much sense for me to go to fedex to pay for printing in the midst of a pandemic and while applying for an economic hardship forbearance. Further, working for a financial institution myself, I know theyve had months to figure out alternatives to solve for this exact situation so that customers dont have to leave their houses or interact with strangers in the midst of a pandemic. \\n\\nDespite their lack of assistance, I was able to have my fianc print the form I needed to sign & uploaded it with the requested signature a few days later. It was submitted prior to my due date & I received notification of the forbearance being approved on XX/XX/20 the same way i became aware of the denial previously. \\n\\nDespite the approval, they still took the money from my account. I called them and told them I needed the money & wouldnt be able to buy groceries unless it was returned. They told me they would process the refund immediately. A week went by, and my checking account was still over drafted because of the payment they took. I called back and they told me they actually HAD NOT processed the refund the week before, and would process it that day. At that point I reached out to my bank to file a dispute because the loan was in forbearance when they withdrew the money and i wanted the overdraft fees refunded also. XXXX botched the refund, and have now the set my principle balance higher than its been since XXXX despite the fact that Ive been making interest payments all along. I should not have to pay interest on the same principle balance more than once as a result of their mistake. Ive asked multiple times for the balance to be returned to the amount quoted in the forbearance agreement. \\n\\nIm concerned that their servicing contract with the federal government has made SoFi customers less of a priority for XXXX, and operational errors like this are more likely to occur moving forward with any additional volume.',\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'Monday XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX I answered my cell phone and talked with a person who identified herself as an employee of XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX. ( every other day of the week, and after XXXX  or XXXX XXXX on Mondays, I usually can not answer my phone personally because I am working. ) The XXXX employee informed me they filed a suit in court on behalf of SOFI, my private student loan company, regarding a {$37000.00} student loan. I asked to return their call within the hour. I wanted to get to a better location so that I could discuss my situation and hear what they had to say. I told the XXXX person I was so thankful to hear from them because I had tried repeatedly to resolve my SOFI student loan problem in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. I explained I had never heard from SOFI since my conversation with the SOFI XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX loan servicing manager XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. In my phone conversation with XXXX  on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX had said he thought he could help me and that perhaps there had been a miscommunication between XXXX and SOFI. He said he would reach out to SOFI \\'s servicing partners in reference to my student Loan 1 disbursed XX/XX/XXXX and my student Loan 3 disbursed XX/XX/XXXX. I told the XXXX person I had been waiting to hear back from XXXX XXXX or someone from SOFI. When I called back, I was put on hold, transferred to the wrong department and misunderstood repeatedly, but was finally able to connect with someone at XXXX who could talk with me regarding my SOFI loan and the suit filed against me. When I asked her to explain what was happening, I was told I needed to pay {$37000.00} immediately or the suit would go to \" judgement. \\'\\' When told her I had repeatedly asked SOFI to resolve the situation and even tried several times to contact XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX she gave no explanation as to why it was so hard for me to contact them. When I asked why I had no other phone calls from XXXX, no contact from them even though I had left phone messages in XX/XX/XXXX, she explained that their privacy policy does not allow them to leave a message on a voicemail which does not have a greeting which specifically identifies the recipient of the message. I explained that I did get a letter recently but it referenced SOFI filing suit and I was trying to get in touch with SOFI to find out what was going on. When I explained that I could not afford this kind of a payment having no assets ( I am in the process of applying to XXXX XXXX  and incurred the loans in a XX/XX/XXXX at University of XXXX that I completed in XXXX ) she then suggested that I could pay within 24 months and then later she suggested 36 months. I replied that I was very interested in repaying my loan, as I always have been, but given my financial situation, the most I could possibly afford at this time was approximately {$250.00} a month. She said this would not be acceptable but to take another look at my finances and call her back. When I told her that I had been trying to resolve this situation with SOFI since XX/XX/XXXX and that I had repeatedly communicated with SOFI directly and as well as XXXX, the SOFI loan servicer, she was not interested in helping me resolve the situation with SOFI. \\nI have experienced this same intransigent attitude with XXXX and SOFI over the past several years, especially in regards to these two loans. SOFI has chosen to interpret the clause \" deferment terms at the discretion of the lender \\'\\' in these two loan agreements in a very narrow way. \" Deferment terms at the discretion of the lender \\'\\' are interpreted as 12 months total of deferment options. This 12 month limitation is not exactly stated in my loan agreement. I discovered this limitation on forbearance options in XX/XX/XXXX. Until this time, SOFI was very gracious as I worked with their career and job development department to complete the necessary requirements to regain my XXXX license and seek a better paying job than my XXXX position. As long as I kept my career coaching appointments and did my homework assignments, my loans were kept in forbearance. I greatly appreciated this novel approach to a student loan company and student relationship. On XX/XX/XXXX I submitted a General Forbearance Request for Loan 1 and 3 and upon calling on XX/XX/XXXX was told there would be no more forbearance on Loan 1 and that Loan 3 was in Economic Deferment until XX/XX/XXXX. This was confusing and upsetting. But that same day, my XXXX year old mother fell and XXXX XXXX XXXX. The emergency room physician at the small hospital where she was initially treated told us there was no treatment for her and that she would XXXX XXXX XXXX of her XXXX. Over the next week we debated as a family to pursue XXXX and decided to go ahead with XXXX XXXX XXXX in spite of the risk. The day of her XXXX I spoke with a XXXX representative who called about my overdue loan from the hospital hallway outside of her room. I was her XXXX XXXX XXXX through the rest of the summer and did not return home until late XX/XX/XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX I submitted a General Forbearance Request for all three loans with a letter and additional supporting documentation expressing my desire and commitment to repay my loans. I also explained that my primary employment was still as a XXXX and XXXX. However, I had regained my XXXX XXXX license and increased my XXXX XXXX employment. XX/XX/XXXX, in a telephone call with XXXXXXX at XXXX, regarding the status of my forbearance request, I was told that my forms were uploaded on XX/XX/XXXX and approved the day before for a suspension of payments which would begin XX/XX/XXXX for 3 months, until XXXX XXXX. He advised me to request a refinance of my loans under a 20 year option and explained that I would need to contact SOFI directly at XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX I discovered Loan 1 and 3 were 7 days past due. Calling XXXX, I talked with XXXX  who told me that Loan 1 and 3 had only 12 months of forbearance-according to how SOFI interpreted my loan agreement, unlike my third student loan with SOFI- Loan 2 disbursed XX/XX/XXXX, which has three years worth of forbearance options. He suggested I contact SOFI and request refinancing. I called SOFI and talked with XXXX  who helped me to submit my request for refinancing. My request was denied, my loans were not eligible for this kind of option. At this time, I had gained enough work to be able to make a monthly payment and somehow avoided going into default status. XX/XX/XXXX I submitted a General Forbearance Request with a  letter and additional documentation explaining that I was working hard to increase my employment through XXXX XXXX but had only gained temporary employment. XX/XX/XXXX I submitted a General Forbearance Request online specifically for the period XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX with a letter of explanation and proof of income. This was granted. XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted a General Forbearance Request with a letter explaining that the temporary work was unstable but that I had been hired in a full time position and needed a little more time to stabilize financially and move through the probationary period. I did not include additional documentation with this request because I had been told earlier by a XXXX representative that it was not needed. This request was denied. No explanation was included with the denial letter and I assumed XXXX/SOFI had changed their minds and decided to stick to their original insistence that only 12 months of forbearance were available for Loan 1 and 3. XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with XXXX regarding my denial and learned that a {$440.00} payment was due on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX for Loan 3 and a {$600.00} payment was due on XX/XX/XXXX for Loan 1. At this time my car broke down unexpectedly on the XXXX outside of XXXX resulting in a {$500.00} towing bill and {$3000.00} repair bill. I was able to pay the towing but needed to borrow from friends to mange to pay the repair bill. By the end of XX/XX/XXXX, I saved enough to make a loan payment. I called XXXX XX/XX/XXXX to make a payment of {$500.00} and was told I only owed {$120.00}. Astonished I asked why and was given the details regarding only Loan 2. Asking regarding Loan 1 and 3, the XXXX person told me no such loans existed and suggested I was mistaken. She refused to pursue the matter with her supervisor. I could not reach anyone at SOFI who could help me. XX/XX/XXXX I sent a letter to XXXX imploring them to work with me regarding loan 1 and 3 and sending more documentation regarding my monthly bills and employment. XX/XX/XXXX I talked with XXXX  at XXXX who located the loans in their system. He said I needed to wait a couple days to find out what was going on. He also looked at my XX/XX/XXXX General Forbearance Request and told me that it was never forwarded to SOFI because supporting documentation was not included. He encouraged me to file again and contact SOFI directly. I could not get through to anyone at SOFI regarding my situation so I called XXXX and XXXX connected me directly to SOFI and I was able to talk with XXXX. XXXX was very encouraging! He thought there was a good possibility that SOFI would make a way for me to pay on Loan 1 and Loan 3.  He assured me that I would receive a call from SOFI. I did not. XX/XX/XXXX, I called SOFI and talked with XXXX. XXXX told me that one loan was in transition to XXXX, a collection litigation firm at XXXX XXXX and someone at SOFI would ask them to get in contact with me. She was not sure about the other loan, it was not showing up in her system. She talked about getting the two loans out of default status through SOFI talking with loan servicing. XXXX did not call me. I also talked with XXXX  at SOFI that day who told me that XXXX had discharged the loans not SOFI and that the Forbearance was denied because of a lack of documentation-a technical detail. She told me the loans were \" pushed \\'\\' into collection with XXXX and that I needed to contact them. Calling XXXX that evening, I spoke to XXXX  regarding the nature of the missing documentation. He said, contrary to what I had been told up to that point in time by various XXXX representatives over the last year, that what XXXX was looking for in documentation was not common house bills but a bill change like a large medical bill or a reduction in work hours. He asked if I had any unexpected expenses and I remembered my car breakdown and the towing and repair bill. He encouraged me to resubmit a new General Forbearance Request to XXXX documenting the car expenses and requesting they back date it to XX/XX/XXXX. I submitted a new General Forbearance Request with a letter and documentation that day, XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I spoke with XXXX at SOFI. He told me that SOFI let XXXX know I want to pay the loans and get back on track. Calling XXXX to confirm they had received this information, I spoke to a XXXX representative who reviewed my General Forbearance Request regarding Loans 1 and 3 sent XX/XX/XXXX and the communication from SOFI. This person told me SOFI was  not referring to loans 1 and 3 but to loan 2. This did not make sense because Loan 2 was in good standing at this time and still is and did not need to get back on track! I asked to speak with the supervisor. The XXXX supervisor told me there was no information in my file about reversing loans 1 and 3 out of default. She said that in order for XXXX to take my student loans 1 and 3 out of default status SOFI must direct them to do so. I then called SOFI again and told them what happened with the XXXX call. I was told that the loan servicing department at SOFI could make that decision, but I needed to call back and ask to be connected directly to the loan serving department. I did call back repeatedly and was told each time that the loan servicing department was not available. On XX/XX/XXXX I called SOFI again. I was told that my General Forbearance Request was \" in progress. \\'\\' I asked to be connected to the servicing department. This time I was connected to XXXX  at the SOFI servicing department who said I had no loans with SOFI! Calling XXXX back, I talked with XXXX who said that Loan 1 and 3 were charged off but that they could be brought out of default status if notification was received from the lender. XXXX suggested a conference call with SOFI, XXXX and myself. During this conference call XXXX at XXXX suggested XXXX at SOFI talk with her supervisor who then confirmed I did have previous loans with SOFI : loan 1 and 3.  However, this supervisor said I needed to talk to an upper level supervisor at SOFI and then have that person reach out to a SOFI person at XXXX. I was then connected to XXXX  in XXXX XXXX XXXX, an upper level manager in the loan servicing department at SOFI. This brings me back to the beginning of my story with the kind words spoken by this manager and the assurances given to me that he would reach out to the servicing partners to find out more information and email me by the next day XX/XX/XXXX. As I told the XXXX person, I have heard nothing from XXXX  at SOFI,  even though I have tried to reach him through SOFI, until the letter I received and the phone conversation with the XXXX representative. \\nThis has been a very long explanation. I hoped to give you an idea of how hard I have tried to communicate with XXXX and SOFI in the midst of family responsibilities and building my employment hours. I believe XXXX, SOFI and  XXXX have colluded to deny me a timely humane resolution to this problem and would greatly appreciate your help in resolving this problem.',\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': 'I started at University of XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX for a XXXX  in XXXX XXXX and successfully put my loan into deferment for three months ( the maximum amount allowed ). Around the time that the three months were up, I submitted another deferment request, because I was still in school. \\nOn XX/XX/XXXX the deferment request was denied because it was not within 30 days of the end date of the original deferment. I received the notification on XX/XX/XXXX. \\nI then submitted another request 1 day before the 30 days started because I figured processing with my school would take at least a day. It was denied on XX/XX/XXXX because there were missing dates of enrollment, however, the national student clearinghouse sent the correct forms with the application. I received this notification XX/XX/XXXX. \\nI submitted another deferment request again after the 30 days began and it was denied on XX/XX/XXXX because it was not within the 30 days of the end date of the other deferment. I had submitted it after the 30 days but since it was signed and dated for the day before the 30 days, they denied the request. I received this notice on XX/XX/XXXX. \\nI then submitted the deferment request for the FOURTH TIME. It was denied on XX/XX/XXXX again due to it not providing a program of study. I received this notification on XX/XX/XXXX. By this point it was so close to XXXX so I was unable to get anything done with my school since everyone was gone on break so I had to wait until after office personnel came back at University of XXXX. By this time it was XX/XX/XXXX. \\nAt this point, I was in direct contact with one person from the registrars office and she sent the deferment request 4-5 times to Sofi/XXXX by fax and by e-mail. The only record that Sofi/XXXX  has of this is XX/XX/XXXX which they took no action and XX/XX/XXXX which they also took no action. I finally got frustrated and asked the registrar lady to just send me the forms directly so I could up load them onto my account homepage. This was against their protocol but she agreed because, I assume, she understood how much trouble this had been for me. \\nI submitted the deferment request again for the FIFTH TIME on XX/XX/XXXX through the Sofi/XXXX  website and I made sure to contact Sofi/XXXX  when I submitted it to make sure everything was filled out correctly. They assured me that it would and that I would not be penalized for this since my account has been past due since I have been waiting for this deferment to go through. \\nOn XX/XX/XXXX they contacted me because my account was past due and that was when they informed me that the dates were not filled out correctly AGAIN. I was forced to pay a month of my loan which I really cant afford right now and now I have to submit this deferment request again. Also, apparently I was given the incorrect information by the previous two Sofi/XXXX personnel who told me that if my deferment request was approved it would retroactively be applied through the month of XXXX. That was not true, thus the reason I had to pay for a month of student loans that I truly can not afford. \\nI am submitting this complaint because Sofi/XXXX have failed to acknowledge my in-school deferment requests. They have created such a burden on me and my school by denying my requests over and over again knowing full well that I am currently in school. I have been prompt with every one of my filings and deferment requests but because of their incompetence, my account is now 37 days past due. I have done everything in my power to get them to accept my deferment requests, but they have utterly failed to perform even the most basic of tasks.',\n",

       "   'complaint_what_happened': \"SoFi advertised new lower student loan refinancing rates after going public, and encouraged me to check my rate ( by offering me SoFi points to check my rate and apply ). Additionally, SoFi advertised via chat and their website that they had a rate match guarantee and would also give {$100.00} along with a rate match. My existing rate was lower than what SoFi showed me after I submitted my information. I asked via chat how to take advantage of the rate match guarantee. I was advised to email my proof of lower rate to SoFi 's customer service. I did so immediately, sending over my last student loan statement and loan approval letter from a couple months ago with my current lender. Two days later I had no response from SoFi, so I contacted customer service via chat. The representative confirmed the documentation I sent over and said all that was remaining was completing my application, which included a hard credit pull. I completed the application, and once SoFi approved it at their initial advertised rate, I returned to chat to have my current lower rate applied per the match guarantee. The new representative said that SoFi would not match existing loans, and that I needed a current rate offer from a competitor. This was different than what had been stated earlier the same day by a different representative. Based on the earlier communication, I only agreed to allow SoFi to hard pull my credit and submit my application under the understanding that SoFi would match my lower rate based on the documentation I submitted.\\n\\nAs of now, I have a ding on my credit and SoFi has changed their stance on what they told me re the match guarantee and promotional credit.\",\n",

I was informed by the agent that if I had the approval letter I could submit my application, as a green card holder. \\nNote : I was logged in so they have that conversation store in their system. \\n\\nI proceed with the application and was approved for up to {$90000.00}. I ended up keeping a {$70000.00} request. Following, they requested me to send me my docs and after a lot of back and forth a agent calledXX/XX/XXXX. stated clearly that I had to submit an I-797 Form with my green card approval to be finally approved. I sent that and after more back and forth the agent XXXX XXXX denied the loan unless I fulfilled this absurd request to add a XXXX or XXXX XX/XX/XXXX holder to my application as a co-signer ( even to get less than {$35000.00}, the opposite of what they stated before ). \\n\\nI refused to do so as I earned a great credit as an individual, paying my bills and taxes diligently and I am the only responsible for my personal finances.

Now, I no longer work at that company, and I make significantly less money, because I'm working for myself, starting a new business. My loan payment is so high, it is more than I pay for my mortgage, and I'm struggling to make my monthly payments. I physically don't have the money to pay such a high amount every month. I've contacted my student loan company, Sofi, several times ( most recently on XX/XX/18 ) to explain that I need to lower my monthly payment to an amount that reflects my new income, but they tell me there's nothing I can do. My account is now delinquent as a result. To make matters worse, they raise my interest rate every month, making this physically impossible to ever day off in my lifetime. I've already paid back the amount I borrowed and then some, ( over the last 13 years ) but still owe the same amount I started with. I'm just looking to simply lower my monthly payment to a reasonable amount that I can keep up with. Please help.\",\n",

On approximately XXXX, we received our first periodic mortgage statement from SoFi dated XXXX with the total amount due and a payment due date of XXXX. Our closing documents included a first payment notice that had an estimated amount due on XXXX. Since the due date of the periodic statement did not match the due date on the estimated first payment we logged into the SoFi system which reflected a due date of XXXX. On XXXX we received an automated call from SoFi stating that we are delinquent on our mortgage payment. I immediately contacted SoFi and explained the only periodic mortgage stated a initial due date of XXXX. On XXXX @ XXXX, XXXX ( # XXXX ) said this was SoFi 's mistake and I would receive a call from SoFi by end of business on XXXX to correct this. I received no call.

This appears to be a bait and switch by SoFi to subject new mortgagees to fees by providing notice of a date due then changing the date due to an earlier date without notifying the consumer so they miss a payment and are subject to fines.

       "  \"Step 1 : What is this complaint about?\\n\\nSofi 's unfair business practices. Their actions support fraudsters instead of impacted hard working and honest customers such as me when someone fraudulently used my identity to obtain a personal loan in the amount of XXXX. \\n1. I had to make numerous calls to them just to find out if any account was open fraudulently in my name but those calls didn't yield any results. I have proof to backup my claim of a 9 minute call to them ( XXXX ) from my cell phone as early as XX/XX/16. And many more calls but no proper answer and no documents were mailed to my residence. It was only after I disputed the loan account with credit bureaus, the truth in lending act disclosure was sent to me on XX/XX/XXXX for the loan dated XX/XX/XXXX. When challenged, all they had to say was they are a paperless office. Paperless at the cost of a hard working and honest customer such as me? Is this really an acceptable business practice? \\n2. Unlike any other financial institution I interacted with, this company reps won't connect me to their fraud department when I mentioned about my identity being misused by thieves. On the other hand, their response always was their fraud department don't take calls. And they won't call me as well and I really suspect if there's any fraud department. Is it too much to expect a expedited response to halt illegal activities sooner rather than letting it continue? Is it legal or fair business practice to let illegal activities continue or to support thieves? \\n3. From my numerous calls, I got bits and pieces of information. One such information was that loan amount was wire transferred to the fraudulently opened account. They won't give me the bank details or account details even after providing all my information that matched their records. I am afraid their actions could land me in more trouble due to thief misusing these funds for illegal activities. What kind of business practice is it to sanction a loan so easily to a fraudster but won't help stop illegal activities? In my last call yesterday, I told them that I will report their unfair and unethical business practices to federal agencies and here I am doing it with the hope of getting these rectified. \\nStep 2 : What type of problem are you having?\\n\\nA personal loan was sanctioned to a thief using my identity but Sofi continues to put obstacles to slow me from stopping further illegal activities.\\n\\nStep 3 : What happened?\\n\\nLate XX/XX/XXXX, I started getting letters from several banks on my credit card applications and loan application s being rejected. Some bank accounts did get opened too. I called each one of these financial institutions to inform them of my identify being misused and also had them shut down such accounts. But, SoFi failed to act in a timely manner and I am afraid this money and related accounts could have been used fraudulently resulting in terrorism or drugs or other illegal activities. This even after I had provided them the police report details to further assist them with their investigation.\\n\\nStep 4 : What company is this complaint about? \\nSoFi Lending Corp XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, UT XXXX Step 5 : Who are the people involved? \\n\\nI talked to numerous people but have only name. The name of XXXX XXXX ( servicing manger ) was mentioned in their letter to me dated XX/XX/XXXX. When I asked Sofi rep to connect me to XXXX, their response was that they don't know who it is. Unfortunately, no extension was given but only the common number of ( XXXX ) XXXX\",\n",

       "  \"We took out a loan with SoFi to refinance our home loan. We were looking to go to a 15 year loan and get a lower interest rate. The entire process was very difficult. They made promises they then did not honor including advertising and telling us there would not be a origination fee but when it was time to close there was, they just called it an administration fee. They also had to check our credit twice do to them making an error and having my husbands name as one thing during their process but with our prior lender it was spelled a different way causing two checks with our credit report. \\nThroughout the entire loan process there were constant errors in the paperwork and details of the loan. They asked multiple times during the process for proof of flood insurance from our current lender. We sent them our flood documentation including the elevation test and the LOMA that was approved. In 2015 we had been removed from the flood zone by FEMA and no longer required flood insurance. I unfortunately did not save every email interaction with them, however I did find one email from XX/XX/XXXX prior to closing on the loan where we once again informed them we were not in the flood zone. We ended up closing on the loan in XXXX, they had everything they needed and confirmed we did not need flood insurance. \\n\\nIn XXXX I contacted SoFi after closing on our loan to see how to go about getting the XXXX  % interest rate deduction on me and my husbands personal loans ( we had received a post card that if we refinanced with them we would also get a reduction on our personal loans we had with them, we were also advised this early on in the refinance process over the phone ). I was told the person on the phone did not know anything about this. They ended up advising me to get the interest rate reduction I needed to go online and apply for a new loan and use the option/reason to get a lower interest rate. I did this as advised ( causing another credit check against my credit ) and was denied. At the time my credit score was XXXX but they said my score was too low to approve the loan I was requesting because they advised me to request it. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX I sent a complaint to their 'CEO ' which I am fairly sure is not really handled by their CEO. After multiple interactions and finally asking them to pull up the original phone call where we were advised we would get the interest rate reduction, I received an email they could not give us the reduction but they would give us {$50.00} ( the said the reduction would have resulted in {$28.00} savings over the life of the loan ). None of my other concerns were addresses and it was dropped. \\n\\nIn XXXX we began receiving multiple messages stating we needed flood insurance again. My husband and I spoke with multiple people every week. We continued to be advised we just had to send in our LOMA. We would send it in and they would come back and ask again. They could not ever find our account. We ended up sending it to the person who handled the above complaint hoping she could help on XX/XX/XXXX. We never heard a response. The confusion has something to do with SoFi and the company who services their loans not having the same account number. We sent the flood documentation an estimate of 6 times from XXXX through XXXX ( they would call every couple of weeks, we would send it every couple of weeks ). We then began receiving letters stating they would force us into flood insurance and purchase it for us. At this point I had contacted FEMA asking for help who also advised the LOMA is what we should need to send them. We were not getting any help from anyone to understand what we needed to do. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX, I emailed the CEO again, I received a generic email from someone saying someone from the mortgage team would get back to me. I never heard anything back. On XX/XX/XXXX I emailed the 'CEO ' again letting them know I would be contacting CFPB because I did not know what else to do. I again received a generic response stating they would be forwarding it to the mortgage team and someone would get back to me. It is now the XXXX and I still have not heard back from anyone. \\n\\nWe did however receive an email on XX/XX/XXXX notifying us that they had purchased flood insurance using our escrow for {$1700.00}. We have not been advised yet how they will pay our other stuff since our escrow will now not have money in it. I assume we will be getting a bill or something soon. We are begging for help. We thought we were doing everything correctly. We continued to do what we were asked to do which was to send in our LOMA. They would not help us understand what was needed to prevent this and then spent our escrow without our permission. \\n\\nWe do not know if we need to contact a lawyer or what to do next. We did go back to FEMA and are requesting a new LOMA even though we have been advised LOMA 's do not expire. We are in the waiting process for that. \\n\\nAt this point we would like to refinance our loan with a different company but can not afford to pay another {$4000.00} closing costs with a different company. We feel we should have been advised prior to closing that we were going to be required to get flood insurance if we refinanced with them or at least had someone help us to understand what they needed before they just spent our escrow. We feel we took this loan out based on false information from SoFi. I do have some emails that I have kept during this process. Please let me know if there is anything else we need to try to resolve this issue. Thank you for your support.\",\n",

When was there ever true resolution to an issue posted other than the company did all they needed to do. This has become a soap box for complaints and that seems all that it is. I see nothing being done to fix the issues with all of the companies lending to students who have always been told that education is everything, education is priceless. My education came with a cost and interest fees and they seem to be endless. There is so much debt in this nation because of the interest that is charged to people wanting to learn.\\n\\nIt was reported around the end of XX/XX/XXXX The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau filed a federal lawsuit against XXXX XXXX and two subsidiaries seeking restitution for affected borrowers and money penalties. The report stated : XXXX  cheated struggling borrowers out of their rights to lower their payments \" through shortcuts and deception. \", illegal practices made it harder for some borrowers to repay their student loans, XXXX failed consumers who counted on them to help give a fair chance to pay back student loans, \\'\\' XXXX said in a statement. \" At every stage of repayment, XXXX chose to shortcut and deceive consumers to save on operating costs. \\'\\' The list went on and on.\\n\\nI felt I fell into this category and I attempted to seek relief towards the loans that had been transferred to Sofi/ XXXX from XXXX. I was only seeking fairness and resolution to get ahead and I had not know earlier that XX/XX/XXXX that I could make a formal complaint through CFPB. I asked that XXXX  pay the ridiculous amount of interest accrued during the time they held my loans, my background like many others started this way : In XX/XX/XXXX I applied for a loan to go back to school. My loans had a 2 % interest rate, upon graduation the rate was 7.7 %. I had put off payments towards the loan until graduation in XX/XX/XXXX I was given a variety of information from my lender that was both misleading and unhelpful time and time again. When I graduated my loans had accumulated to XXXX   dollars, I did what I could to start to pay back the debt but never could get ahead. In XX/XX/XXXX XXXX finally informed me about the income based repayment and for 3-4 years I made payments totaling almost 13 thousand however my loans gained XXXX of interest over the period of time and I now owed XXXX.\\n\\nI had no choice but to refinance with another lender, Sofi/ XXXX . When I refinanced the loan after the payments I had made for three years the total amount was for XXXX dollars. Sofi seemed the better option with structured payments, it seemed to be my only option of clearing my debt someday. I was poorly informed and I feel defrauded by XXXX XXXX/ XXXX. My claim submission reply through the CFPB website from the company was that they had billed everything correctly on their end, that\\'s it.\\n\\nXXXX  created obstacles, and misinformed me throughout the history of my loans making paying the loans down impossible. Now Sofi/ XXXX have my loan and the one rep I had spoken to stated that people have loans forever. Who wants to live like that, how is that something to look forward to? Sofi/ XXXX have no income based repayment program setup and I currently can not afford to make payments on my loan.',\n",

I discussed this with the loan officer XXXX XXXX  and he verbally told me that the 2.25 % was locked for 60 days. \\n\\nShortly after this, Texas experienced a severe ice storm and I was without power and reliable access to email for almost a week. The two weeks immediately following this were extremely busy for me as I am an engineer in the power industry. \\n\\nWhen I resumed working on my loan application in early XXXX I was told that my loan application had been withdrawn for failure to provide a W2 and recent pay stubs. I never received these requests, and when I searched my inbox I found that XXXX had quarantined them as suspicious, since they were sent using a 3rd party application and were flagged as likely phishing attempts. \\n\\nMr. XXXX then explained that I was not locked at 2.25 % as he had led me to believe. He then created a new loan at 2.625 %, half a percentage point higher than previous. I was unhappy, but this was still a lower rate than my current mortgage so I continued with the application. \\n\\nMr. XXXX XXXX began handling most of the paperwork from this point on. Some of the issues with Mr . XXXX include : - Providing me the wrong email address to request a payoff quote from my current lender. This delayed the application by nearly a week, since he did not respond for several days when I informed him of the bounce. He then wanted me to call in and sit on hold during a very busy workday to expedite the payoff request. \\n-One version of the disclosure form had the wrong school district and county listed for the escrow account. I raised this concern several times beginning in early XXXX and still have not received acknowledgement of this error. \\n-For the employment verification, I clearly explained that my local work address is just a field office and that the HR department is located in another state. I provided the phone number for HR. Instead, Mr . XXXX performed a XXXX search and called the number listed for my local field office. This led him to speak to a salesperson, whom he proceeded to ask several personal questions about my income, job performance, bonus pay, etc. This was a gross violation of my privacy. The salesperson to whom he spoke is a subordinate of mine. My salesperson asked Mr . XXXX to instead contact HR, but Mr . XXXX was insistent and went on to discuss personal details of my finances with someone who works under me. \\n-Upon confronting Mr . XXXX about the violation of my privacy during the improper phone call to my salesperson, Mr XXXX XXXX accused my salesperson of lying to me about what was said in the call, despite the completed questionnaire showing the answers to these exact questions as filled out by Mr XXXX XXXX. \\n\\nFinally, today Mr . XXXX provided me with the details of the final closing, which has already been delayed. The interest rate quoted is now a FULL PERCENTAGE POINT higher at 3.625 %. This is equal to my current mortgage. I strongly suspect that much of the incompetence I experienced was designed to delay the loan process so that the 60  day rate lock expired and enabled SoFi to raise my rate significantly at the last minute.',\n",

I submitted all appropriate forms and paperwork related to my public and private student loans through their online portal. However, they had significant difficulty 'validating ' the private loan. Over FOUR MONTHS I was asked repeatedly to upload promissory notes, proof of loan educational status, and other correspondences with my private bank loan, each time finding a new form or reason to delay the process. Because of these delays, I had to upload work pay stubs, interest statements and proof of employment MULTIPLE TIMES because a prior example would 'expire '. Additionally I was subjected to MULTIPLE HARD CREDIT PULLS because of the delays. As over four months of acquiring sensitive, personal financial information has yielded continuous roadblocks, I can only assume their business practices are ultimately fraudulent and designed to acquire this information for financial gain.\",\n",

In order to start the process i had to get appraisal done and i paid SoFI {$520.00} to have appraisal scheduled. \\nAppraiser came on XX/XX/2021. In his report i found mistakes that would affect the comparable and value of the house. The mistakes i found were 1. Missing half bath, misreporting of updates by saying no major updates done in last 15 years where as complete first floor remodel was done in last 2 years plus second floor flooring and paint. At first when i brought this up SoFI loan officers did not understand and told me i needed to provide them with list of houses that would be comparable and all the details in \" reconsideration of value \\'\\' document if I want to try to have the appraiser review his findings. Even after paying the money for appraisal i was told to fix the problem. They told me that because the underwriting had accepted the appraisal they can not do anything. i had lost my trust in the company at this point as they are accepting falsely documented information for such a big transaction. At this point i wanted to get my refund for the appraisal so i can go somewhere else for my refinance needs. They took long time to resolve the appraisal issue and that caused me immense stress and missed opportunity to get a good rate in timely manner. They insisted on fixing the report saying the value does not change since the missing info is not significant. Even though they gave me updated report it was prepared for SoFI and it is useless for me. I am still under distress because of this issue. Their own team is sending me decision that the mistakes on the report was not significant and we have decided to not refund the money. I believe that if it was the other way around and by mistake my house value was more because of an additional bath, they would have said it was significant and take money off so they can give me higher rate. I believe, they should refund me my money but I am really looking for an impartial 3rd party to give me a good reason why the company does not need to give me a refund. So i can move on and never work with them again. Thank you',\n",

       "  \"Recently I decided to move to Sofi to refinance my student loans to a lower rate. A representative from SoFi informed me on the phone that if I have a Sofi Savings Account, I will get a 0.125 % discount for my student loan refinance. So I did. I opened the savings account. When my loan was funded, I see now that the promised 0.125 % discount never materialized. When I called SoFi, they said that I needed to have a positive balance in the Savings Account. I mentioned to the representative that no one said anything to me on the required balance amount. The representative said even a {$1.00} of balance would have helped you with your discount. \\n\\nSo basically based on the miss-information and the promise of the 0.125 % discount that Sofi provided, I moved to SoFi. Not only I did not get it, but also the representative did not even try to work out a solution. SoFi has the recordings from that day and if you listen to it, you will hear the miss-information. I have attached the recording from my conversation with SoFi representative that he agreed for me to record from today 's call. \\n\\nThis is not right that a company gets away from giving miss information and the consumer is left alone to the corner after they get my business. I could have gone to another company with a lower rate like XXXX XXXX, but choose SoFi based on the additional discount.\",\n",

I submitted all required paperwork, as did my cosigner ( my spouse who is on a XXXX XXXX through marriage ). After two weeks of hearing nothing from XXXX, I contacted them multiple times at the end of XXXX -- both on the phone and through their live chat -- to discuss what the hold up was. It was uncovered that they were having an issue contacting my future employer to verify my offer letter. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called them in person after spending a few hours of my own time to find additional contact information for my new company 's HR. I was told then that the application was complete and would finish processing in shortly. The next day, I got hit with an address verification request for documentation because we had just moved. XXXX stated that they would only accept a bank statement, but I had not received one with the new address because we had just moved a few days prior. Once I told them this, they decided that they were willing to a screenshot of my bank 's website showing the updated address. That same day, I logged in and noticed that XXXX had unilaterally updated my requested loan amount from ~58,000 to over 80,000, which I at no point requested them to do. It took two phone calls and three web-based live chats to get this problem solved. Then, this morning, XX/XX/XXXX, they requested an XXXX for my spouse, who was acting as my co-signer so that we could get a better interest rate. We have only been married for two years and have not yet been required by the USCIS to file the XXXX, as my spouse 's initial XXXX XXXX still has validity. Had SoFi told us in their application materials that we would need an XXXX, we would never have filed the application. Their omission of this during the initial stages of the application has led to considerable wasted time on my end and has dinged both of our credit reports with hard inquiries. Today, XX/XX/XXXX, I called into XXXX and spoke to a supervisor for the third time in two days about my application. They told me that if I could not furnish an XXXX they could not move forward with my application. At no point prior to this, not even in my various phone calls and web chats with them about this application did they mention this possibility or that they would need this document. Today, I talked to XXXX, one of XXXX 's supervisors. When it became clear that they were not willing to work with me on this issue, I notified her that I expected XXXX to immediately remove the hard inquiries from both mine and my co-signer 's credit reports and that I would be filing a CFPB complaint.\",\n",

       "  'I initiated a mortgage refinance loan with Sofi on XX/XX/2020 and was told that it would take approximately 60 days to close ; however the loan is still not closed due to repeated mistakes on their part. I am not submitting any documents or records for this complaint, since all of the issues I am describing can be verified by documents in my Sofi account portal and through emails with Sofi staff that have handled my loan. \\n\\nI submitted all required paperwork for the loan to them on XX/XX/XXXX and had the home inspection was completed by XX/XX/XXXX. We received conditional approval for the loan on XX/XX/XXXX, on which day we also submitted contact information for employment verifications. At that time I was told that no additional paper work or information was needed from me and that the loan would go through regular processing channels ; however from that point forward until today Sofi has made error after error which has resulted in a routine mortgage refinance taking almost 6 months. Below is a summary list of the issues that we have had with Sofi : 1 ) Staff do not routinely return phone calls, voice mails or emails. They do not acknowledge receipt of paperwork, information or requests for assistance/clarifications.\\n\\n2 ) Staff routinely lose or fail to file paperwork and information that they collect ( employer verifications, documents that come to them directly from current mortgage holder etc ), which results in the applicant needed to follow up on their behalf and to request the same documents/information multiple times from employers, mortgage companies, city tax offices etc.\\n\\n3 ) The process for managing the loan is completely unclear and staff are unable/unwilling to explain who/which offices or departments are responsible for the loan during different points in the timeline. The initial \" loan officer \\'\\' is a person that seem to have no actual engagement with the loan after the preliminary paperwork is signed. He is the only point of contact for whom an email and phone number are provided, yet he is completely unreachable. I had to comb through the Sofi website and make dozens of calls to any phone number I could find on the website to get connected to managers of the various departments that handle the process. The amount of effort I have had to exert to get information and feedback from this company is ridiculous.\\n\\n4 ) Despite Sofi senior staff admitting that they have made major mistakes with my loan, they do not seem to have capacity to oversee the processing to ensure that it moves forward efficiently and effectively. Each time there was a problem they assured me that they would address it immediately ; however even if they resolved one issue, others arose due to staff who seemed inexperienced and/or did not review the information diligently. At various times it seems that the staff managing the process lost track of my application or were so overwhelmed with other work that they could not follow up with me for weeks. This resulted in the interest rate being extended five times and my family having to submit 12 sets of paystubs and 6 months of mortgage and bank statements ( so far ).\\n\\n5 ) Some of the most egregious problems that have occurred so far include what may be considered as predatory lending practices ; 1 ) failure of Sofi to send us ANY closing documents until 3pm of the day that we were scheduled to sign the documents in front of a notary at 5pm ; 2 ) the closing documents that were sent were incomplete and did not contain information on the monthly payment that was due ; 3 ) the closing documents stated that we needed to provide {$2600.00} cash at close, which was not what had been agreed upon in multiple earlier conversations and emails ; 4 ) the failure of Sofi to provide a SINGLE person who could answer any of our questions after we received the incomplete and inaccurate CD ( two staff that were responsible for my loan were on leave and the other was unreachable ) ; 5 ) inability on the part of Sofi to cancel the notary appointment ( that they scheduled ) after I emailed everyone to let them know that we could not sign the documents since we had not been able to review them fully or get answers to our questions ; 6 ) pressure from the notary that they hired to sign the documents ( he claimed that he could not leave my house without either the signed documents or instructions from the loan officer - of course he could not get in touch with the loan officer ) and ; 7 ) learning after the closing fiasco that the {$2600.00} cash at closing was to cover city taxes- which had already been paid in full by the current mortgage company.',\n",

       "  'I am writing to you to raise a concern about the application process that resulted in my application for a student loan refinance being denied after having been originally pre-qualified. The process was quite frankly humiliating and predatory because of the lack of response/awareness of SOFIs customer service team. I detail my experience because I believe this is a failure that shouldnt be repeated with other customers. \\n\\nApplication for Student Loan Refinance. I applied for a refinance of my student loan online at www.sofi.com on XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$10000.00}. My motivation for doing this is that my credit has improved since I first received the original loan, and I wanted to decrease my interest rate. I received an immediate response from SOFI that I was pre-qualified to refinance my loan with a new rate of 4.864 %, with a monthly payment of approx. {$200.00} for 5 years, and I was asked to provide my checking account information for payment of my monthly payment ( Attachment 1 ). I was very happy with these terms and looked forward to completing this process. \\n\\nOn the week of XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted SOFI several times, to provide things like my paystub, and also to inquire about 2 missed calls that I had from SOFI that week ( the calls came in when I was working ). However, every time that I reached customer service, I was informed that there were no actions items for me to complete, and that the application was being reviewed. I was patient, until by surprise on Saturday XX/XX/XXXX I received a notification via email that my loan application was denied. At first, the letter did not specify a reason for this denial and instead to contact SOFI for the reasoning behind this. \\n\\nAfter contacting customer service, the system stated that my application was denied because my identity could not be verified. I was shocked, since in the 5 exchanges I had with customer service agents that week, none of them informed me that SOFI needed to confirm my identity.\\n\\nPredatory/Deceptive Practices by SOFI. After receiving this notification, I called again and specifically asked about the problem with verifying my identity. The SOFI customer agent stated that because I have an identity fraud alert in my credit profile ( my information was indeed hacked in the famed XXXX  XXXX XXXX of XXXX and subsequently found in the dark web ), SOFI needed to verify my identity. But because I did not pick up the phone when SOFI called, the system had automatically denied my application and there was no way to recall this application even though I was ready to provide whichever verification was needed. Then the customer service agent told me the only way to re-start the process was to complete a new application. I was concerned but re-applied, but here comes the kicker : I was denied. \\n\\nConclusion. As a consumer, the lack of response from SOFI, by keeping my in the dark, and by the mixed messages that I received from customer service agents that somehow lacked the proper training to understand my application and convey accurate information about what was needed resulted in my first application being denied, and subsequently, after denying my application and telling me that because of this I needed to submit a new application, I was denied again really impacted me emotionally. \\n\\nI had a lot pending in this restructuring of my debts, and to me it feels SOFI took me for a ride. The situation that forced the denial of my first application, and then deceived me into believing I just needed to re-apply when in reality an automatic denial was waiting for me ( we dont event need to pull your credit a second time I was told by the customer service agent in an effort to convince to reapply ). \\n\\nAll of this feels predatory, and even much more so when it touches my financial well-being. SOFI markets to young professionals like myself with messages in your website that there arent Hidden fees, No Catch and Fast/Easy/All Online Applications. Well in my case, SOFi ran a hard credit pull, bated me into applying twice, and the process was far from fast, easy or fully online. \\n\\nVery Respectfully, XXXX XXXX',\n",

The representative explained that the bonus would typically be deposited to a SoFi Money account, however I informed the representative that I attempted to apply for a SoFi Money account the day before, but was denied. The representative then explained that as an alternative, I could sign a Form XXXX and provide the XXXX details of XXXX of my external checking accounts, in order to receive the {$590.00} bonus to my external account. While still connected to this representative on the live chat, I navigated to the section of SoFi 's website that the representative guided me to, where I electronically signed/dated the Form XXXX and entered the account and routing number of my XXXX XXXX checking account XXXX I was then told by the representative I would receive the {$590.00} bonus within XXXX days of when my loan was approved/funded. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/2022, which was XXXX days elapsed from the time of my personal loan being funded back on XX/XX/2022, I still had not received the {$590.00} bonus to my external XXXX XXXX checking account. Therefore, I chatted with SoFi once again on XX/XX/2022 to inquire on the status of my {$590.00} bonus funds. The representative did not provide any helpful information as to why my bonus had not been paid out to me- considering that I met the requirements of the offer in terms of applying for and being approved for a personal loan, and having signed the necessary XXXX and provided my external account details for XXXX. The representative told me that opened a ticket for me ( Ticket number : XXXX ) and that the relevant team would look into the matter of crediting my bonus to me within the next couple days. \\n\\nNow, it is currently XX/XX/2022, and I have not received any update from SoFi on my open ticket number, and I still have not received the {$590.00} bonus to my external checking account as part of this promotional offer that I took part in, and it is well past the XXXX day mark that SoFi informed me I would have received this bonus by. \\n\\nTherefore, I am filing this complaint to formally request that SoFi honor the {$590.00} bonus be paid out to me as per the offer I engaged in and fulfilled all requirements from my end.\",\n",

       "  \"I received a notification from my credit monitoring servcie that a new loan inquiry had been made. I reviewed the information and determined that it was a fraudulent loan application and therefore opened a case with the credit monitoring service. A representative from the credit monitoring service called me and we placed a conference call to SoFi Lending who made the credit inquiry. The various representatives and supervisors we spoke were unable to locate the loan appliction using my email address and phone number. Since criminals would likely use their own email address and phone number as to not tip off the person they are trying to scam, they obviously were not able to find any loans using that data. We continually asked if they could look it up using my social security number to which they said they can not. This seem rediculous considering that is the information that was used for them to pull my credit in the first place. Since the loan does not show as being opened at this point it was our hope to be able to stop the loan from being opened and reported on my credit. The representatives from SoFi continually told us that they aren't able to search by social security number so therefore we would simply need to wait for the loan to fund, then file a police report and then dispute it with all of the credit bureaus. It seems that their system is set up to enable fruad instead of stopping it. While I don't know the rationale behind these policies I'm guessing it is financial in some way, shape or form. Why can a company pull my credit using my social security number, but not be able to look up a pending loan application using that same information and prevent fraud from happening. What a terrible company. If criminals are reading this then I'm sure they know that if they want to commit fraud, SoFi is the place to do it.\",\n",

This information contradicted the previous information they provided and Sofi had been in receipt of  my co-signor 's XXXX information as of XX/XX/XXXX.

I attempted to refinance my loan because I am currently in an adjustable rate and it continues to increase. I am beginning to struggle to make the payments and this will continue to worsen if my interest rate continues to increase.\",\n",

All but the XXXX loan are currently serviced by XXXX. \\n\\nI recently have been working to get my credit score up so I could refinance the 4 private loans. My reasons for wanting to refinance are to get a lower interest rate and to remove my mother as a cosigner. I also add that when I was XXXX-XXXX, these private loan companies had no issue lending me this money. \\n\\nI have been reaping these private loans since XX/XX/XXXX and been making consistent payments ( never missed a payment to my knowledge ) other than the three years I was in XXXX school and they were deferred. The balance of the private loans is currently approx. $ 35k with a weighted interest rate of apron 8 %. If I am able to refinance at 6 %, my payment will decrease by over {$250.00} a month in just interest. \\n\\nI submitted a refinance application with Sofi. I submitted all requested information including my XXXX tax return and my XX/XX/XXXX P & Ls along with bank statements for verification. I am being told that my averaged income for the two years is $ XXXX, which I do not have a problem with that number based on the averages. \\n\\nMy issue is that they are telling me my income doesn't support a refinance and it is solely related to my income. I was told my payment history is fine and my credit score is fine. They can not lend to me solely based on my income. \\n\\nSo my main question/complaint is : How can they lend to me at XXXX-XXXX with no income and no credit history, but when I apply for a refinance at XXXX, making the most money I have ever made and the best credit history I have ever had, they don't see me as credit worthy for the loan? Oh, and might I add, the payment that I have been making consistently since XX/XX/XXXX ( minus XXXX school years ), will reduce by over {$250.00} per month with this refinance. So they do not have faith that I will make a {$250.00} less per month payment than I am currently making now. The only sense that makes to me is they are losing interest by reducing the interest rate and they have no benefit to approving this refinance. \\n\\nSo why not add a cosigner again you ask? well I tried that based on Sofi 's recommendation. To everyone 's surprise, she was denied? The same cosigner who was approved when I was XXXX-XXXX  with substantially the same credit score and income when I was XXXX-XXXX, is now all of a sudden denied when I am XXXX, making the most money of my career.\\n\\nHow can student loan companies loan money at high rates to XXXX-XXXX year olds trying to get an education and then refuse to refinance the same loans when those same students become adults and actually have income and credit?\\n\\nHow is this acceptable?\",\n",

In attached documents you will see the principal amount, interest rate, and monthly payment amount. The job market has been tough, so I have been working several part time jobs, XXXX XXXX to make ends meet and have been trying to find salaried work for about a year and half. No luck, so I plan to obtain a XXXX certificate and become a XXXX in the coming year to two years. \\n\\nSince I have been expected to start making monthly payments, I think I have been able to make a total of 4 or 5 payments. SoFi has worked with a little bit, they granted me two 3 month long Economic Hardship Forbearances and these have helped immensely. However, there is a limit to how many of these you can be granted throughout the lifetime of the loan. ( As a side note, none of the representatives I ever talked to informed me the there was a limit on the amount months you could be in Economic Hardship Forbearance. Luckily, I read this in the fine print randomly on their website. ) I have used 6 of the 12 months allotted for my loan lifetime and am weary of using the other 6 when the lifetime of the loan is so long. I ca n't guarantee that I wo n't be in a similar financial hardship in the next 20 years, so you can understand why I want to avoid burning through this forbearance allowance in the first year. \\n\\nFor XXXX XXXX, I have been unable to make the monthly payment. I was doing fine until we hit the slow season at work ( XXXX XXXX during the holidays is hit or miss, for my job unfortunately it has turned out to be a huge miss ). So I called SoFi today  ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX ) to inquire about ways to lower my monthly payment. They forwarded me to XXXX, the company that works with them to process all payments. I spoke to XXXX who said my only options are to either 1 ) refinance or 2 ) apply for an economic hardship forbearance ( the  forbearance I described above ). I explained to him that neither of those options are reasonable because one, refinancing requires a hard inquiry on your credit ( which isnt worth doing when nothing drastic about my financial status has changed since the original financing of the loan ) and two, for the reasons mentioned above, I do n't want to use more months of the economic hardship forbearance. \\n\\nI then inquired about an income driven repayment plan to help adjust my payments to the income I 'm making. He reminded me these types of plans are only for federal loans, not private ones and basically said, sorry, youre out of luck. He told me to have a good evening and the phone call ended. This conversation unfortunately mirrored past conversations with SoFiXXXX where I left feeling hopeless and even more stressed out about the looming monthly bill.\",\n",

The amount I was quoted with the refinance application was under {$700.00}, which would allow me to make my full monthly payment and not have to apply for forbearances. \\n\\nHowever, the application was 'stalled ' because when I connected my XXXX account to my Sofi application, an communication error between XXXX and SOfi occurred. on XX/XX/XXXX, I called SOFI and was told to call XXXX and ask that they updated their files. I debated why I should have to call XXXX when the issue was between Sofi and XXXX - I had provided all documentation and information requested of me. In the interest of time, I tried to submit the student loan documentation they were requesting manually, but it would not upload to my application. I therefore emailed SOFI directly with the information/documentation. A few hours later, I received a denial of my application - even though I was 1. told to apply, 2. pre-approved, and 3. have a very high credit score, good income, and no delinquencies on my credit report. \\n\\nIn follow up emails, SOFI explained the reason was because I had not provided documentation of my income and that I had I had a bad internal credit score with SOFI due to my use of forbearances. I had provided documentation of my income, and I'm receiving a 3 % raise in XX/XX/XXXX. Also, these forbearances were approved by SOFI and I was never told that use of necessary forbearances would impact my ability to refinance in the future. Nor was this mentioned as a potential barrier when I was told to apply for a refinance of my loans. \\n\\nI'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. I'm trying to do what is responsible and necessary in order to not go into default with my private student loans. I asked for guidance on what to do to lower my payment and was told to refinance by SOFI, was preapproved, and provided all necessary documentation/information for my application. By denying my application, SOFI has essentially removed the only mechanism I have to lower my monthly payment amount. This is not being customer friendly or helpful to someone with a high student loan debt burden.

I followed up on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX and still was unable to receive a response about whether the check was cashed. Since there is no phone number available for customer service, I chatted with support on XX/XX/XXXX. I again inquired as to whether the check for {$66.00} was cashed. The support person told me he could not find out and the issue would have to be \" researched. \\'\\' I explained that I had already been told it was being researched as of 6 days prior, and I still hadn\\'t received a response. I asked to escalate the issue and file a complaint, and was told that a complaint had already been filed even though I did not file a complaint previously. I then asked to speak to a supervisor and requested a call back, but I have yet to receive any call back. So SOFI has taken the money from my account and held it for 2 months but after a week is unable to provide me with any information showing whether the check has been cashed, meanwhile I am being charged late fees for the payment being late because I am unable to produce any record showing that it was received by XXXX. SOFI offers this banking service but is unable to provide the basic details associated with the transactions.',\n",

SoFi 's system does not show that I have a loan through SoFi, and customer service has refused to help me locate my loan. \\n2 ) SoFi was misleading about its school deferment policy at the time I applied for a student loan, and the actual policy is unreasonable. \\n3 ) SoFi 's Customer Service has no idea what its own terms are. When I called in and spoke to a Supervisor on the Customer Service line, I was given information that is blatantly false - that SoFi has NEVER offered student loan ( only student loan refinancing ) and that SoFi has no in-school deferment policy. \\n\\nWhen I applied through SoFi, I was informed that I could defer student loans if I returned to school. I tried to contact SoFi when I started XXXX school this XXXX. I was told to work through SoFi 's student loan servicer XXXX. The first SoFi/XXXX customer service representative said that it would be taken care of, but that, contrary to my prior understanding, I was still responsible for making monthly interest payments. Since my other loan provider ( for another student loan ) had taken care of this without my input, I had no reason to doubt this. When I noticed that my account was still being auto-debited for the full amount, I called in and was told that I had to submit a formal loan deferment application, which was not mentioned during my first call. After I submitted the application, it took three months to process. The deferment took effect after it finished processing and only applies for 3 months, from XXXX to XXXX of XXXX. This makes no sense. I have been in school and in contact with SoFi and XXXX since end of XXXX XXXX. Since the current deferment only applies to XXXX to XXXX, I have been billed full payments during months when I should only have been paying interest. Since a normal XXXX semester runs from XXXX to XXXX, I now have to go through this entire process again, 3-4 months ahead of time, in order to have my interest deferred for an additional month. I spoke to someone at XXXX, the loan servicer, and was told that this was SoFi 's policy and that I should speak to them to see if they could make any changes. \\n\\nWhen I called SoFi 's customer service line, I was told a number of things that are not true. First, I was told that I do not have a student loan through SoFi. I was told that their system shows no active student loans and only XXXX subsequent loan refinancing applications ( which were rejected ). When I escalated the issue to a Supervisor, I was told that SoFi does not provide any kind of in-school deferment and that SoFi has never provided student loans. At this point, I asked the supervisor how long he had been working with the company and he admitted that he had not started working for the company until some time after XXXX, which was when I received my student loan from SoFi. \\nI asked the Supervisor if he could further escalate my case, but he said that he was the top of the chain. I asked if there was any way he could look into the matter, since I am certain that I do have a loan with SoFi and their records are incorrect. He said I could send documents to the general customer service line and they might open an investigation. I spent over an hour and a half speaking with SoFi 's customer service, and I am extremely frustrated that I am being forced to jump through so many hoops just to confirm that my loan, which I have been making payments on for 3 years, actually exists. I can not make any modifications to the loan repayment schedule, such as the in-school deferment period, because XXXX tells me that only SoFi has that authority, and SoFi refuses to acknowledge that I even have a loan with them.

Then around the next month, they claim they made a mistake for 5 % but it should have been for 3 % cashback, which is fine for me. I can understand and accept that. I was earning 3 % until XX/XX/XXXX ( therefore I was only earning for around 2 months only ). The 3 % started becoming 2 % cashback and I spoke with phone reps 2 times to dispute this and once on online chat. I was still qualified since I met the {$1000.00} per month in direct deposit. I was also told that they would investigate the situation and see what went wrong. Today is XX/XX/XXXX. I have yet to hear a response back so I decided to message them on chat. The chat rep said that I hit the cap of XXXX points for the 3 % promo. I do not recall any maximum cap for XXXX points. I was not given any terms of conditions that stated that I had a cap of XXXX points. As I ask the chat rep to provide the terms of condition for further proof, the chat rep stopped answering me. Screenshot will be provided of the chat log. I think that Sofi is abusing their system and not following their own protocols.

However, there was a third account at XXXX that did not receive a distribution. I checked the other accounts at other institutions ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Bank XXXX XXXX ) to see if they'd received any distributions. They had not.

In order to complete my application for refinancing, I needed to establish my income for XXXX and XXXX. \\n\\nWhen I opened the loan I was a W-2 employee, but in XXXX XXXX, I left that company and started my own XXXX.

They also asked for business banks statements which I was able to upload into their system. \\n\\nKeep in mind that they were insisting that I file my taxes before the XXXX deadline. I pointed out that I owe the IRS money this year. Why would I lose 4 months of cashflow in order to save 4 months of lower interest payments? My federal tax bill exceeds the interest rate savings by thousands of dollars. \\n\\nUltimately I told them that since they couldn\\'t accept my tax documents anyway, even if they were completed early, I wanted to withdraw my application.

       "  'Systemic bait-and-switch operation with SoFi and offered interest rates. <P/>In XX/XX/XXXX, I applied for a refinance loan of {$26000.00} on the remainder of my Federal Student loan balance. In the application process I provided my requested information including my current annual income of {$120000.00}. They pre-approved me for a 5 year fixed loan for the amount requested at a rate of 3.99 %. I applied for the loan and provided requested pay stubs for income verification purposes. These paystubs from the end of XX/XX/XXXX showed year to date income of {$51000.00} which I used to calculate the annual income I submitted with my application of {$120000.00} scaled for 12 months. None of this income was bonus or commission type income and was all directly related to my profession and work as a XXXX XXXX. <P/>SoFi told me that they would not accept this income for verification purposes implying that a portion of my income would be treated like bonus or commission type income for which they ask 2 years of prior XXXX statements. Specifically, approximately {$40000.00} of my current annual income out of the {$120000.00} is regular XXXX reported taxable income ( not XXXX ) from picking up extra shifts at the XXXX ( not overtime and commonly referred to as \" moonlighting \\'\\' in the XXXX XXXX ). I do n\\'t believe a reasonable consumer would believe that this is bonus or commission type income, and there is no information available that would suggest this type of income would be treated differently for verification purposes in the application process ( SoFi does specifically mention bonus or commission type income on their website though ). <P/>SoFi then tells me that they would no longer be able to offer the rate of 3.99 %, but that the good news was that they were still able to conditionally approve me at a new 5 year fixed rate of 5.115 % ( 28 % higher than the 3.99 % rate they had pre-approved me at ). <P/>At that point I was thinking, oh well, SoFi as a private company can set whatever standards it wants for its lending as long as not discriminating or breaking other laws. But then I read other reports on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau website and found that many others reported similar experiences of being pre-approved at one low rate, and then experiencing some type of difficulty in the application/verification process outside of what a normal/reasonable consumer would expect and then being told of the good news of being offered a higher interest rate than the one they were pre-approved at. This higher interest rate is offered after the consumer has provided their protected financial information and authorized a hard credit check ( which hurts their credit ) and SoFi can then share/sell/use this financial information in a proprietary way while not honoring their marketed or pre-approved rates in good faith.',\n",

However because correcting Sofis clerical error resulted in 2 reversals in XXXX it showed we did not make XXXX payment which in fact we did and it was received XX/XX/XXXX. So it showed we were delinquent and behind on payments even though we were not so then it kicked off the auto pay for XXXX. So Sofi tried saying we were late for both XXXX and XXXX.

No one can give me updates. They cant transfer me to anyone to follow up. No supervisor can call me back. They even sent me to collections department rather than acknowledging their error and fixing the situation to show I did make the XXXX payment. Since their error resulted in XXXX payment not being drafted we wanted to wait till XXXX was accurately posted to make the XXXX payment however in the mean time finally yesterday XX/XX/XXXX out of fear of my credit showing Im behind 2 months mortgage I made 2 more payments ( a second one for XXXX and my XXXX ).

According to the promissory note each payment would be in the amount of {$2000.00}. With auto pay that rate was reduced to 3.256 %, which I understand would serve to accelerate the number of payments, and not decrease the monthly payment amount. Since the loan funded I have had the following payments automatically withdrawn from my checking account : XX/XX/XXXX - {$2000.00} ; XX/XX/XXXX - {$2000.00} ; XX/XX/XXXX - {$2000.00} ; XX/XX/XXXX - XXXX. Notably 3 of these amounts are different, and all are above the {$2000.00} amount included in the promissory note. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I received correspondence from XXXX, the SoFi loan servicer, that my repayment schedule had changed. It reflected an interest rate of 4.006 % and a monthly payment of {$2000.00}. I contacted XXXX and although they could not confirm why I received that letter, they assured me my rate was 3.256 % I requested a copy of my promissory note, which was provided to me by XXXX. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, as I was reviewing my bank statments, I observed the above funds withdrawals and contacted SoFi. Initially I was told by SoFi that this concern needed to be addressed directly with XXXX. When I informed them that I had already tried, and reminded them that my agreement to repay the loan pursuant to the above terms was with SoFi, i was told they would address the issue. I forwarded to XXXX XXXX, of SoFI, attachments that evidence the promissory note sent to me by XXXX, export of bank statements evidencing the withdrawals, and correspondence from XXXX evidencing the 4.006 % I was told on XX/XX/XXXX that it may take 24-48 hours to get a response from XXXX.

In the denial letter SoFi recommended I visit their \" trusted partner \\'\\' XXXX. XXXX is \" able to approve some people that SoFi can not \\'\\'. I complained via email on XX/XX/XXXX, as I was denied for having \" obligations exceeding income \\'\\' ( with no explanation as to what that means ) and despite having a credit score over 800. The reply stated that the factors evaluated included credit history ( score over 800 ), level of education ( XXXX ), years of professional work experience ( 3+ ), and income ( over $ 50K ). I responded that their letter stated one reason, but their generic email reply stated it was a constellation of factors. I also complained as it appeared that they send pre-approval letters in order to send applicants to their \" trusted partner \\'\\' after denying them ( potentially making them more desperate ). My email was then forwarded to a customer service rep who responded on XX/XX/XXXX that she would like to schedule a meeting to discuss the denial. I replied that I was not interested in having a verbal conversation, and wanted their explanation in writing. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a reply from a different customer service rep indicating that they had written a \" clarification \\'\\' letter that contained \" additional details \\'\\', and that I would be removed from their mailing list. The letter states that I was declined for \" excessive obligations relative to income \\'\\' and \" other - does not offer credit terms requested \\'\\'. I responded with further questions - SoFi says they calculate my \" obligations \\'\\' based on averages ( not actual figures pertinent to my situation ), so I want to review what those numbers are. And what does \" does not offer credit terms requested \\'\\' meant as I had made no requests. I had requested no dollar amount, no APR - I was sent a pre-approval letter. I also requested that they delete the account I had to create as I do not want my account hacked and information stolen. The second customer service rep replied on XX/XX/XXXX that the calculated debt to income ratio would cause the possible interest rates to exceed what Arkansas restricts to. I don\\'t live in Arkansas. He was also unable to give clarification on what number was calculated as my average as it is \" proprietary company information \\'\\'. He did say my account would be deactivated, and I could visit their privacy policy webpage. I responded with the information that I do not in fact live in Arkansas, and that I would make a complaint concerning their business practices as they are opaque, and their goal continues to appear to be to drive would-be customers to a \" trusted partner \\'\\'.',\n",

The credit card company \\'s own app showed that the payment posted ( not pending, but posted ) on XX/XX/2022. The payment is also shown as having been drafted from my checking account at another bank. I have tried to use the card, but it is being declined. I called customer service and was told that the payment posted but that I would need to wait another 2-5 business days before the payment would actually be credited to my account. I don\\'t understand why they are showing the funds as posted, drafted out of my deposit account, but SoFi will not acknowledge that payment for several additional days. I have never missed a payment and have not overdrafted this account. It appears that the card company is using my funds for several days before after the payment is shown n SoFi \\'s system as having been posted. This practice of essentially holding funds for a week is depriving me of my use of the funds without compensation. At minimum, it is deceptive and misleading to relay to a consumer that a payment is \" posted \\'\\' but then failing to actually apply it to the statement balance for several business days.

Neither of us has taken out multiple loans.

       "  'Good day. I am writing to make a complaint about SoFi, a lending company based in XXXX XXXX, CA. This company has deceptive practices as well as does not follow the letter of the law with regards to offering financial services, qualifying a borrower and lending based off the provability of the borrower. \\n\\nMy journey started when I applied with SoFi for a {$25000.00} personal loan. My application was submitted approximately XXXX10 days ago. I completed and uploaded everything requested from this company. About XXXX7 days later, I called to inquire about the status of my application. At that time, I was told that \" no one had looked at it yet and it would be assigned right away. \\'\\' Based off the conversation I had with the representative, I did not feel comfortable. At this point, I saw on the site the CEO of the company lists to email him directly with any feedback about the process. I did just that and also listed out my experience in lending and asked, based off what they \" advertise \\'\\' that they look beyond a few factors I know that would come up. No it is not bad credit ( XXXX score ), it is not BK \\'s or foreclosures - it is the overuse of credit recently and inquiries. I knew this and reported it to the CEO himself. I was not concerned about my qualifications of the fact I have the availability to repay. \\n\\nAfter sending this email, someone was finally assigned to my loan. At first, the woman on the phone did not understand my bonus / commission income. I was asked to send my employment contract and that she would \" talk to a manger \\'\\' to see if they could do it. This morning, I got the call. \" XXXX XXXX, you are approved. We worked everything out with your income, we can use it. I just need you to email you XXXX and XXXX XXXX \\'s. \\'\\' They had everything else, they just needed to documentation. \\n\\nOnce I uploaded all I had, I received a call back from SoFi. This time XXXX was on the phone. XXXX said, \" XXXX XXXX, I am sorry but we are not able to give you a loan. I know we just told you that you are approved, however since we received your email we changed our minds. \\'\\' Basically, because I was real and transparent with the CEO, they decided to cancel my loan and say \" I do n\\'t qualify. \\'\\' When I said, \" I guess I should n\\'t have sent that email \\'\\' she proceeded to say, \" Yeah, you should n\\'t have. \\'\\' After this, I received the \" you are denied \\'\\' email and then I requested the adverse action. In that they list my excessive debt to income ratio. So I went from \" you should n\\'t have emailed the CEO to my debt to income is too high \\'\\' ALL this after I was told I was approved. \\n\\nAs you can see from my email attached, I was very transparent. They pulled my credit, it was a XXXX and my income based off the call I got this morning was \" acceptable and you are approved. \\'\\' I have been in XXXX 18yrs. I understand things happen. In this instance, there is nothing here for them to deny my loan. They basically are discriminating against me because I emailed the CEO. I do n\\'t want people to get hurt anymore. Shallow promises are not what our country is about. I am a veteran XXXX, I live by honor and commitment. This company has none of these XXXX. \\n\\nI have attached documents for your review. Please feel free to contact me for a personal interview if needed. \\n\\nI would also like to point out, based off the XXXX C \\'s of lending ( Credit, Collateral and Capacity to repay ), none of these are negative for them to deny my application for credit. They have shown me no proof of such and are in direct violation of the CFPB \\'s rules about discriminating against a consumer that qualifies for a loan.',\n",

And I completed enough steps to finish the loan, so they say. They had a snooze option, which would keep the loan from funding until XXXX expired. They funded the loan early. I apparently did not cancel in time. They didnt send the disclosures until 5 months after I allegedly agreed to the loan. I am a public university employee and getting trapped in this loan will cost me an extra {$43000.00} and 5 years. SoFi represents itself as my bank, but is really hard selling me any kind of loan they can through an App. I dont think I ever signed up for this loan, and regardless, SoFi holds itself out as my bank and is rewarding me with cash bonuses and incremental small bonuses to progress through the application process, not disclosing material facts in a timely manner, and now refusing to return my loan to federal, even though I asked before XX/XX/XXXX when it funded. I had tried emailing and calling even earlier to cancel, but they only communicate over Chat. And robot chat. I am hoping someone can help me. Simply by following steps in an app I turned a XXXX loan into a XXXX loan with a 6 % interest rate. I dont even know how it happened, and now I am in a Terrible position. I write because I need help and I also think it would be terrible if SoFi got a bank charter and could harm more people. Can you help me follow up with SoFi or direct my complaint to the appropriate agency? \\n\\n\\nOn Wed, XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX PM XXXX XXXX XXXX wrote : Hi XXXX, I never agreed to this loan. \\n\\nThe awarding of diamonds as people upload documents, the snooze feature and the early trigger of loan funding is inherently predatory. Potential borrowers should receive robust disclosure. Not subjected to a gameification scheme by which people are lulled into loans. More concerning, is that you would even elect to enroll someone in a loan that will cost them {$43000.00} extra. That is Inherently predatory. Also unkind and disrespectful. Not actions of a company wanting to gain a bank charter. The communication with SoFi has also been difficult and void of any humanity. SoFi conned me into this loan likely because of my low vision status and the snooze feature expiring too early. Also, Your failure to provide prominent disclosures about the attributes of this loan is also troubling and what I would call overly cagey, probably predatory. The fact that policy changed dramatically re : PSLF while we were snoozed and you didnt change any disclosures or require updated signatures is also very cynical. SoFis scamming me into this loan is morally reprehensible and I hope you will connect me with a manager before I proceed to take further action. \\n\\nI also find the complete lack of desire to act in best interests of your customer throughout this process to be concerning.

We accepted the terms and proceeded to provide proof of income by uploading my most recent paystub and our latest W2 just in case. SoFi asked for my mobile number as well as my personal banking account to wire payment and to setup the auto-draft each month for repayment. After providing all my personally identifiable information to their system, I was told they would reach out if they needed anything additionally. \\n\\nThe next morning I received a rejection letter citing \" UNABLE TO VERIFY INCOME \\'\\' as the reason. I immediately called SoFi \\'s toll free number XXXX and the customer service rep said that it was because I had a credit lock on my account and I could apply again tomorrow if I removed it. I notified the rep that we had no such lock and she continued to reiterate applying again. I asked to speak with a supervisor and was informed that someone would call me back because they were all busy at the moment. \\n\\nAfter not receiving the call back as promised, on XX/XX/XXXX I reached out again to the toll free number and went through almost the same explanation. I then again asked to speak with a supervisor and this time I was connected to XXXX. I detailed my trouble and explained that maybe the system had a problem with my application due to an outage or something because I had provided everything their system had asked for and maybe he could review it for me by a human. He stated that even though we provided paper copies of my last paycheck and the W2 from the employer from the latest year, they couldn\\'t approve the application because their \" PROPRIETARY \\'\\' system of income verification couldn\\'t verify my pay. When I asked if they reached out to my HR department to verify employment or asked the IRS a form XXXX for digital verification he stated no, we don\\'t do that and again reiterated the PROPRIETARY system they have used. XXXX also stated that there was no recourse because they will not disclose how they verify income thus preventing me from remedying the problem with my bank or HR or whoever else they contact to validate my income. \\n\\nDue to the attempt to resolve the issue directly with a person in authority with SoFi and their inability to legitimately provide reason for rejection, I feel this company is engaged in fraudulent loan practices or is profiting from selling sensitive data to 3rd parties or something like that. My credit is impeccable, credit score of XXXX, stable job for 10 years, current on taxes, homeowner, etc, etc, etc. So the PROPRIETARY system they are using to verify income is either a bogus excuse or the company never intended to extend credit in the first place. In other words, Fraudulent! \\n\\nUpon request I can upload the SoFi rejection letter as well as the documents I uploaded to prove income. ALL of these document are most current including the last pay period as well as most current year W2. I can also provide sworn and notarized statement from my bank of 30 years and my employer of XXXX that no one reached out to verify income. \\n\\nIn closing, I am truly aghast that SoFi is unable to hand process and verify someone\\'s loan. Had I known that only robots ran this company, I never would have applied there. Now my personally identifiable/sensitive information ( which must be kept for 25 months they informed me ) is in the hands of this inept company. Now I must worry that I\\'ll be the victim of a hack one day because they released all my info to some third party or something and made a quick buck off me.

They also had a promotion that ran concurrent with the overdraft protection but for direct deposit itself. If you set up direct deposit you would get {$100.00} as a welcome bonus.

I was told by a manager that my direct deposits are being coded as deposits. Due to this misnomer, no fault of my own, they never gave me access. I emailed, I went on social media, I spoke with various departments. I was told to wait like 2 weeks and then once I qualify with the {$1000.00} deposits again, it would work. I subsequently moved my deposits elsewhere since I need overdraft at time, and after months of qualifying and even getting a bonus paid out due to direct deposits being received, it is infuriating that they did nothing despite my numerous complaints to provide me the benefit they dangled to cause me to get the account. I have since been told that I would just need to qualify again with the deposits in order to get the overdraft, which they fixed now for my account I guess.

I do not understand how these accounts could be opened first of all online, and second without the presence of the individual to verify a signature, an address, proof of residency, and proof of identity. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX a loan with SOFI Lending was applied for in the amount of {$19000.00}. The loan was approved and funds transferred. All this came about when a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, from XXXX XXXX   was sent to an old address I had not lived at for more than 20 years. In this letter, it stated they denied opening an account for me, an account I never applied for. The letter suggested I contact the credit agencies to see if there was anything affecting my credit report. On XX/XX/XXXX, I went online and reviewed my XXXX Credit report where there was a recent inquiry for SOFI Lending. Not knowing who this company even was, I contacted them that same day to get some information. I spoke with XXXX who confirmed that a loan was applied for using my name, date of birth, home address, home phone number, but a different email address. I immediately let them know I did not request any type of loan with their company and they should put my claim in as a fraud incident. She informed me that a block would be put on the account for review and that they would get back to me with a reference number. It was XXXX who also informed me that the whole loan transaction was completed online. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I reported the identity theft to the FTC. I also added a freeze and security alerts with the three credit bureaus, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. I was able to make a police report in person at my home on XX/XX/XXXX with an Officer from my local police department. \\n\\nNot hearing back from XXXX XXXX, I called again on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to XXXX. It was then when I requested the reference # to my fraud case. When I asked what type of identification is given to show proof of identity, I was told that they request any of the following : a copy of a driver 's license, passport, or income statement. When I asked what they received I was told that it was the underwriting department that had this information on file. I asked to speak to the underwriting department but I was told that I could not. XXXX also mentioned that since I reported the incident, they would do an investigation and remove the loan from my credit report. It was also at this time when I was asked if I wanted their Fraud Packet, in which I did request. \\n\\nAfter receiving their fraud packet and reading through it, it requested giving more personal information such as my driver 's license ID # and copies verifying my address, driver 's license, passport, or utility bills. Of course not wanting them to have any more of my personal information than they already had, I made my third phone call XX/XX/XXXX. I began asking questions about this fraud packet but the specialist could not answer my questions, it was then that I asked to speak with their manager XXXX. After being on hold for more time than needed, a specialist, XXXX, picked up the line. Frustrated at this point, I asked my questions again, only to get the same unsure answers. I did continue pressing for answers, like why did they not make a phone call to verify my information prior to lending this money like the website states in the Q & A section ( XXXX had my home phone number on file ). I was told that sometimes these processes are not necessary and that their policies change depending on the need. Thats poor policy right there. I also asked how could it be that not one letter or any confirmation of the loan was sent to my home address ( also on file ), I was told the whole transaction was opened and completed online. I found this very hard to believe and needed to know more. Not knowing what type of account the {$19000.00} was transferred into, I asked where and to what type of account XXXX transferred the funds to. Again, not being able to give me all the information I needed, I was able to get the name of the bank, XXXX, and the last 4 digits of the account number. \\n\\nI then contacted XXXX XXXX  and spoke to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, I discovered that they too open accounts online. When I asked some of the specifics about the account such as identification given to open the account, address on the account, again I was road blocked and could not get the information I needed to protect myself from the fraud situation taking place. I alerted them too that although the account was opened in my name and with my social security number, it was a fraud and I did not authorize or open an account with them. They opened a fraud case number and informed me that I would be receiving a letter from them within 30 days. Since I did not request an account to be opened with XXXX, Im hoping that after receiving their letter ( not knowing what it even is going to read ) I will be able to close this account. Frustrated and upset, I pressed XXXX XXXX for further information as to the address attached to the account, they would not give me the address but when I asked if it was even in the state I live in, I was told it was not. I'm not sure how SOFI Lending could so easily transfer funds to an account without verifying that the information on the account matched the information in their files. \\n\\nSimple steps could have been taken to alert me to this incident sooner. SOFI Lending has failed to do any : 1 ) Send a letter, perhaps with an ID pin to the address associated with the person who's social security number is being used for the account. The letter, once received with the ID pin, could be used to call the company to confirm that the letter was received at the proper address. \\n2 ) Require additional information such as copies of utility bills, paystub, or insurance bills to again verify the address 3 ) Compare and verify the address and all information on the account funds are transferred to 4 ) Make a phone call like stated on their website in the Q & A section\",\n",

Towards the end of the process of getting approved and submitting the final documents I asked XXXX if the company that led me to them had to be paid their fee or if there was a way to avoid that. My questions was due to them not helping at all in the approval and documentation portion. To my surprise she had no idea there was another company involved and told me that we'd have to create a new account separate from the one that was pretty much approved. When I created another account it pulled my credit score again and declined my application ( They are supposed to use the same report for  60 days if I am not mistaken ). When that happened XXXX said she would talk to her supervisor and see if they can override that decision since I was already in the process of being approved and all documents looked good. She said she would get back to me and let me know. She never did and I had to call her for a decision. She told me that there was nothing they could do and the original account that was approved was now auto-declined as fraud!!! I was completely caught off guard and upset that I was being penalized for being honest and for not knowing that the people I first talked to were not working with SoFi. I then called the gentleman from XXXX XXXX to tell him what happened and that we were no longer working together. He explained that he has no way of intercepting funds, and that our agreement was under a power of attorney and his fee would only be due after I had received the money. Completely separate. I told him I still did not want to continue to work with them and the said that would not be a problem. I called XXXX to explain that I no longer had any obligations with them and that if there was any way we can plead to her superiors to use my original credit report for the new account or to open a new application. She said she would check with them and let me know ASAP. A week went by and no word from XXXX. I then called today to see if I can get an update and now conveniently it is against their policy to transfer me to speak to XXXX and they able to put in a call back request but can not guarantee that it will be XXXX to call me back.

I contacted Sofi Loan originator and Member Specialist starting on XXXX to find out the status of the loan. Several emails were sent by me and the Loan originator to the Member Specialist with no result. Finally, on XX/XX/XXXX I contacted Sofi management making them know how disappointed I was about the lack of communication/interest in my loan. On XX/XX/XXXX I was contacted by an Operation Manager who apologized for the previous Member Specialists lack of communication and that they assigned you a new Member Specialist that was a lot better with communication. \\nThe new Member specialist asked for a couple other documents that we provided right away. We then were notified that our closing date was set for XX/XX/XXXX ( but cancelled ) and then XX/XX/XXXX and that I will have to pay about {$200.00} for closing cost at closure. Nevertheless, on XX/XX/XXXX I received a call from the Member specialist that the closing will have to be cancelled because they missed a document ( Home Equity Refinance Disclosure ) that I needed to sign since I are from Texas. This will also require to wait 12 days before closure. It is to note that the disclosure was only a notification but the specialist want me to just sign somewhere and return to them. \\nOn XX/XX/XXXX I communicated to the Member specialist my dissatisfaction for the continuous cancellations and that we wanted assurances that the third time was going to be the charm. \\nI also asked several questions ( answers in parenthesis received on XX/XX/XXXX ) : 1. Are you going to send us another closing package with corrected amounts, dates, etc.? I guess we need to start over with the XXXX signatures. ( You may get another closing disclosure but this will NOT reset the waiting period. It is just for you to see the current actual numbers if anything was updated ) Yes, the lock has been extended and your interest rate is the same. \\n3. When is our first payment will going to be now? - Since we are closing in XXXX your first payment will be in XXXX. \\n\\nIt is interested to note the email that the Member specialist sent on XX/XX/XXXX asking : \" I believe 12 days was the time frame for the TX HELOC waiting period, is this calendar days or business days. I would like to re- schedule the closing today, but need to know the earliest day the member can close. \\'\\' This shows the lack of knowledge of regulations. \\nThat same day I asked again about the closing documents : \" Am I going to get a new set of CD? The current final documents have different numbers, dates, etc. Is that also going to affect the closing date? I expect that we will know soon what are the closing cost, closing date, etc. \\'\\' On XXXX I was notified of the ( third ) closing date was set for XXXX. \\nOn XXXX I again communicated to Sofi \\'s Member specialist my concerns about closing : \" I received the invite for closing scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX. Do you know when I am going to get the final Closing Documents? The current final documents need several updates. I would like to know at least how much is the cash to close.

This was due that since the loan took so long to process we now were less than 2 months from paying the taxes, insurance, etc. \\nWhat really made us to be concerned us was that the member specialist suggest that to \" help us \\'\\' Sofi could add the extra $ XXXX to our loan. This suggestion made my wife and I very concerned about Sofi \\'s ways to do business and made us loose trust on Sofi.\\n\\nAfter three months working on our refinance and three unsuccessful closing dates, we decided that we rather not do business with Sofi since we consider that we were unfairly treated by Sofi and that they either wanted to deny us the loan ( discrimination? red lining? ) or wanted to make more money increasing the loan amount as suggested.',\n",

       "  \"On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, my daughter started an application with SOFI to refinance her private student loans. The rate she was quoted was high, so she listed me as a co-signer to get a lower rate. I received an application to complete as a co-signer. Once completed on line, I expected to see the new rate offered on the loan. However, all I received was a loan agreement to sign stating that I would make payments etc. When I called SOFI and spoke to a random agent, she said I could not see the rates and terms until I signed the loan agreement. She told me what the original rate was that my daughter qualified for on her own, but would n't discuss what the new proposed rates were since I had n't signed the loan agreement ( remember we are still in the application phase of this loan. ) When I refused to sign the loan agreement until I saw the terms, she suggested that I contact my daughter and have her look up the terms. My daughter discussed the terms she received which sounded reasonable so I went ahead and signed the loan agreement. However, I still had no access to the terms. My daughter signed her loan agreement and I received an email on XXXX XXXX, XXXX saying that she had signed the loan documents. I went on line to view the terms and still was not granted access. I called and was connected with a random agent and explained that as a co-signer I had the right to view the terms of the loan. The agent said that my daughter was the primary borrower and I was only there in case of default so I was not entitled to see the loan terms and documents. He suggested that I sign in as my daughter so I could see them. I am a co-signer on the loan, not a guarantor. I believe that banking regulations treat co-signers as co-borrowers and am appalled that I had to sign a commitment to pay without seeing the terms first hand in a document. Even after I signed and requested the loan documents, I was denied access. I realize SOFI is not a bank, and have contacted you to make this a formal complaint. I have had to commit via a loan agreement to a refi of a student loan of just over {$99000.00} without seeing any of the terms.\",\n",

The origination process with Sofi Mortgage was easy but starting early in the process I had many misgivings about extra fees but went through with the process. Once the time came to process the loan I went through multiple \" member specialists. \\'\\' They did not complete tasks they said they would, did not follow up in a timely manner and outright lied about stipulations of the loan. We ended up having to bring more money than expected to closing. During the time of acquiring the loan I let it be known that my husband and I were in dealings with the State and would be negotiating the price of a portion of our land for the road widening happening in front of our home. I was told that our loan would have no issues with our dealings with the State and they did not conflict with each other as long as our loan was in good standing. After initially being told our loan would close in early XXXX, the loan did not fund until XXXX due to issues with Sofi. Currently, my husband and I have made an agreement with the State of Texas for a portion of our property to be bought for road expansion. The last needed document for the transaction to close is a partial release from Sofi. I contacted Sofi for this document who then sent me an email address to request the form from. I received a denial letter a week later stating that it was due to our loan not being seasoned for 12 months. I then contacted the Partial Release Department and learned that that part of Sofi is actually serviced by XXXX. I was advised that I could ask for an exception for the partial release from XXXX  XXXX. I THEN had to contact XXXX  XXXX  and asked what needed to happen in order to request the exception for the partial release. I was then referred back to the \" servicer \\'\\' in order for a Form 236 to be filled out. Once I contacted Cenlar back in regards to this form I was told that they could help with this request but the form would need to be filled out, I would have to acquire appraisals and a lot of other tasks that would be forwarded to me. I am beside myself to put this plainly. We trusted a company to help us get the best mortgage possible for our family and it has turned into one issue after another since XXXX of last year. I have raised my concerns with Sofi through the mortgage process and I simply given an \" I\\'m sorry \\'\\' and we will get this fixed to which the issues were never fixed. I feel like this loan was predatory in nature. My husband and I are hard, honest workers. We work hard for the home we have. We pay our mortgage and take care of our responsibilities but I feel like we have been trampled all over by Sofi Lending. Had I known the truth and knew that not having a loan for 12 months would make this process with the State come to a head then I would not have signed the loan agreements. If we do not get a partial release then we can run the possibility of eminent domain proceedings starting and our land being taken by the State.',\n",

       "  'I am having an issue with my loan refinancing agency. I have refinanced my private loans through XXXX, and Sofi/XXXX XXXX. The loan is a 7 year XXXX refinance loan with an interest rate of 5.375 % fixed loan. The loan was issued XX/XX/XXXX. The initial agreement was for a $ XXXX monthly payment for a total of 54 months. I applied for the loan during my XXXX XXXX and finished my XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. After XXXX, I pursued a fellowship in XXXX XXXX. I am currently not an XXXX XXXX and have one and a half years left before I can start getting paid like one. Since my XXXX was finished the loan reverted to full payment after 6 mths. I applied to re-instate the {$100.00} as I had not utilized the full 54 month period. However, my application was declined because the loan company had realized that my school was not a XXXX XXXX school at the time of my graduation. They told me it was an accident that they even let me refinance in the first place, as they did not check this prior to issuing my loan. However, now they are charging me about $ XXXX/month. I only make {$62000.00} yearly and am in no way able to pay this off with my current salary. I have called them numerous times and have been constantly redirected between SOFI, and SOFI/XXXX. I tried to apply for forbearance through SOFI/XXXX, and they declined my application as they reported I am do not meet the criteria for economic hardship. I then looked to refinance my current loan again through SOFI and they keep declining stating that my school is not a Title IV school so they would not make any changes on the loan. In short, the loan company is not allowing any flexibility in reducing my loan payments or restoring the original contract to {$100.00}.

Additionally, I am unable to refinance the loan through other companies as even they believe my monthly payments would be more than my current income.

       "  'I began my initial application process with SoFi XX/XX/2017. My existing loan is a federal consolidation loan with XXXX XXXX. I applied with my father, a partially retired XXXX as my co-signer, as recommended by SoFi for help in approving a lower interest rate quoted initially at 4.95 %. The following documents were requested initially : recent pay stubs from employer, current loan billing statements, XXXX, and copies of personal identification documents. The process then became unwieldy with incessant requests for more documentation. One of the first requests was for my co-signer to upload his last 6 months of bank  statements as his recent retirement made his last pay stub unreliable to reflect his income. My co-signer and I were under the impression this would suffice to complete the application. Then again, I received another notification for additional documentation including my co-signers XXXX and statement of retirement income. And yet again, this did not suffice. My father and I began reaching out to customer service and spoke with various specialists assuring us that all that was needed was just a one more document. There was only one email early on in the application process which outlined the requested documentation ( see attached ). After this, there was no instruction about which documents were needed but rather I had to navigate through my account online and deduce which sections were missing an attached document. This resulted in time consuming calls to customer serve and with equivocal recommendations.\\n\\nEventually my application expired for incompleteness despite reassurance from an account specialist that application would not expire if I was actively working on completing the upload of additional documentation requested. I decided to re-apply and had to start the whole process over and a host of new documents were requested including new pay stubs, XXXX documents from co-signer, a new drivers license photo with better resolution, IRA statements, 401K information, deferred income statement from co-signer and co-signer tax returns from last 2 years. We thought we were finally complete with the new application when a request for both my co-signer and myself to contact our employers and have them complete these eight requests : name, job title, date of hire, confirmation of pay frequency, confirmation of salary, confirmation that the employee is employed, confirmation of job status, and validation of work contract ( see attached ). \\n\\nAt this point I was fed up with the charade of requested documentation and the fact SoFi, a reputable name in the student loan refinance industry, would request my employer to get involved with my personal debts. This was an absurd request and it was very odd that this was not brought up at the beginning of the application process. I therefore requested to close my application and requested to talk with account specialist to ensure all my documentation was destroyed as SoFi had in their possession numerous private financial information. Given SoFis history of poor customer service, I was not surprised when I reached out to SoFi customer service and was told that all escalation specialists were busy but that one would return my call. I never received a call. I am extremely disappointed with the cumbersome nature of the SoFi application process and hope I can save others from this frustration. Furthermore, SoFi needs to be investigated for their inability to properly and truthfully explain the application for student loan refinancing.',\n",

       "  'There are three problems with the way I was treated by SoFi : ( 1 ) First, on XX/XX/XXXX, I responded to a solicitation by email, from SoFi, which said I would be given a .25 % discount on a student loan refinance, if application were submitted before XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX I filled out an on-line application for refinancing my private student loan. In the online application, I listed my net income as {$150000.00}, based on the income I have earned this year, XX/XX/XXXX. SoFi \\'s application did not request, at that point in time, that I list my income from years prior to XX/XX/XXXX ; it merely asked for a statement of my income. Then, On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email saying I was pre-approved for a rate of 4.25 %, with monthly payments of {$490.00}, fixed rate for 15 years. On XX/XX/XXXX, I responded to SoFi \\'s request for tax forms for the years XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, along with additional financial information, which I provided. I am self-employed and received net income of {$90000.00} in XX/XX/XXXX and {$110000.00} in XX/XX/XXXX, respectively. Between XXXX and the XXXX XXXX, I received two more emails requesting additional financial information, to which I responded with a total of 30 pages of documents. At no time did SoFi ask me to clarify my ( correctly stated ) statement of income for XX/XX/XXXX. I continued to see on my SoFi dashboard that the rate I had been offered would expire on XX/XX/XXXX. Then, that same day, XX/XX/XXXX, I received another email from SoFi, which revoked my offer of 4.25 % and replaced it with a new offer of 5.175 %. \\n\\nThe explanation provided by SoFi was as follows : \" The interest rate quote we initially provided was based on the {$150000.00} annual income entered in your application. However, the income entered in your application differed from the income we were able to verify using the documents we received. Due to this discrepancy, your interest rate quote has changed. \\'\\' I believe SoFi \\'s application process was unfair because the income I provided at the outset was correct and I was not presented an opportunity to prove it. The low, 4.25 % rate offered was merely bait to induce me to do a lot of work to apply, only to receive a higher rate, based on an incorrect explanation. \\n\\nNote : I have more than enough disposable income to pay the monthly amount required by either of SoFi \\'s offers. My credit score is XXXX. I receive numerous solicitations weekly to open up new lines of credit. SoFi \\'s justification for increasing the interest rate, based on what SoFi incorrectly states was an inconsistent statement of income, is baseless and was merely a pretext to increase the interest rate that it offered, and unfairly induced me to engage in their loan application process. \\n\\n\\n( 2 ) Second, today, XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter by email from SoFi that revoked my offer of 4.25 % and replaced it with a higher offer of 5.175 %, under an expiring deadline for SoFi \\'s initial offer of 4.25 %. I believe providing a deadline for a low rate, and then revoking it with less than 24 hours left under the deadline, after a fair attempt to comply, is a pressure tactic and is unethical it itself. This method of conducting business is also a burden to me, and probably countless other consumers, because of the weeks I have invested in pursuing SoFi \\'s original offer. \\n\\n\\n( 3 ) Third, SoFi has no internal complaint process for consumers. I was able to speak to a manager, on a recorded line, but he said there is nothing he can do to help me. I asked for the opportunity to speak to someone at a higher level, or to file a formal complaint, or to engage in arbitration to address my complaint, but he said there is no one else to speak to, there is no internal complaint process for consumers, and there is no arbitration program. However, the manager said that he was filing a \" complaint \\'\\' for SoFi \\'s records, to improve the application process but not to provide me, the consumer, with any avenue for relief. He said there would be a record number generated after our call, but when I asked him for the record number, he said he could not provide it unless SoFi receives a court order to provide it. He said I could probably get a copy of the phone recording, but only if a court orders it. I asked him for his full name, but he would not provide it, except for his first name and last initial ( \" XXXX XXXX \\'\\' ). I asked him for an acknowledgment by email that I had complained, with a copy of SoFi \\'s \" quality control \\'\\' complaint number, but again he said I do not have the right to receive any record of my concerns. In sum, I believe SoFi is engaging in \" bait and switch \\'\\' tactics with consumers, is arbitrarily revoking offers and replacing them with dramatically higher offers, and is not serving consumers or the business community by failing to have ANY internal dispute resolution process to resolve customer complaints.',\n",

       "  'My loan has been grossly and intentionally mishandled by agents of both SoFi and XXXX, which I aggregate for purposes of this report. The two institutions have colluded with each other to coerce me into making payments on my loan which should be in deferment. I have to date spent countless hours speaking with agents at both institutions as well as administrative and executive officers at my university in an attempt to solve a problem that SoFi-XXXX has created regarding the status of my loan. I have been very polite and cooperative for several months. However, it has become clear to me that SoFi-XXXX has intentionally established and implemented policies in order to abuse its power as a lender, harass me, inflict emotional distress on me, and coerce me into making payments which I am not obligated to make pursuant to my loan agreement. SoFi-XXXX has fraudulently recorded my loan as delinquent internally when it is in fact in good standing since I am a XXXX XXXX and I have furnished SoFi-XXXX with countless documents to that effect in a timely manner and when requested. In addition, SoFi-XXXX has fraudulently reported my account as delinquent to XXXX   for the current balance of {$14000.00}, and I continue to be subjected to harassment by XXXX representatives for payments I am not legally obligated to make. I have set forth the details of SoFi-XXXX fraudulent, abusive and harassing conduct below. \\n\\nBefore this problem, my account with SoFi-XXXX was at all times in good standing and I have always made payments on time. In XX/XX/XXXX, I returned to school to begin a XXXX. program. I therefore contacted SoFi-XXXX well in advance of this date to arrange for an in-school deferment. SoFi-XXXX had required that its deferment requests be signed and stamped by the university registrar. The first form I submitted on XX/XX/XXXX was denied on the basis that my program would not begin until XX/XX/XXXX of that year. On XX/XX/XXXX, therefore, I submitted a new form for in-school deferment, which was accepted. The loan was properly put into deferment. SoFi-XXXX, as I was informed, has a policy that deferments are to be processed in three-month intervals, with a new form being submitted each time. Although this policy is not in my loan agreement, I understand that policies are usually established in order to foster efficient administration. So I complied with the policy politely, despite the fact that the process is terribly inconvenient because it requires quite a bit of processing time on both ends resulting from SoFi-XXXX unreasonably demanding requirements. The next form, which I submitted on XX/XX/XXXX, was also accepted. \\n\\nHowever, the form I submitted on XX/XX/XXXX was denied. It is at this point that the pattern of abuse and coercion by SoFi-XXXX begins. The reason given for this first denial was that the form did not indicate that I was enrolled in a graduate program. This is an entirely unreasonable grounds for a rejection of this form. To begin with, SoFi-XXXX has information in my file indicating that I have already obtained an XXXX degree, an XXXX degree, and a XXXX   degree. Moreover, the first two forms for the Fall semester, which indicated I was enrolled in a XXXX program, were accepted and on file. A student can not be downgraded from a XXXX   candidate to an XXXX candidate at the same university. And in any case, even if this were possible, it would make no sense for me to switch to an XXXX program since I already held an XXXX and several advanced degrees, which was well known to SoFi and XXXX. In any case, as the registrar of my university explained to me, it filled out the form correctly. The form asks for the program of study, which is essentially the discipline in which the candidate is studying. It does not ask for the degree program, which is why the registrar did not include this information. Nonetheless, I returned to the registrar, had them indicate XXXX on the form, and resubmitted it. The registrar sent it in directly, and it seems that SoFi-XXXX ignored this form. I then submitted it myself on XX/XX/XXXX. This second form was then rejected on the ground that it was the same form whereas a new form must be submitted. Again, this was simply a delay tactic by SoFi-XXXX. There is absolutely no difference in the forms and no reason why a brand new one should be submitted other than to delay the process. Such abusive delay tactics became clear when SoFi-XXXX then shifted my account into repayment even though it was clear to all parties that I was still a XXXX XXXX and the forms I was submitting were being rejected on purely administrative and unreasonable grounds. Since I had been on an automatic payment program in order to keep the interest rate down, SoFi-XXXX deducted my bank account for the amount they fraudulently recorded as due for the month of XX/XX/XXXX. I was told by a XXXX representative that XXXX would not refund such payment even if the deferment were appropriately reinstated for that period. This constitutes theft, and I have therefore been forced by SoFi-XXXX to take my account off automatic repayment to protect myself from similar theft by them in the future, which increases the interest rate to their benefit. I then diligently submitted a third form for the same period. XXXX did not find any administrative insufficiencies in this form, but rejected it anyway for timeliness : they delayed so long reviewing and unreasonably rejecting the previous forms and the most recent one that when they finally made a decision on the most recent one, the academic semester had ended. XXXX claimed that the form verified me as a student only though XX/XX/XXXX ( the end of the academic semester ), and even though that period obviously covered the month of XX/XX/XXXX, they rejected it outright. In the first place, as will be further explained below, the form does not verify me as a student only though the end of the semester. What it does is verify that I am enrolled in courses that end in the Spring. In order to verify my continued enrollment, I submitted another form on XX/XX/XXXX indicating my course enrollment for the Fall semester. This form was rejected on the basis that its period was too far in the future. After explaining all of this to another representative at XXXX, I was told that the two forms were reviewed together by SoFi ( finally ) and rejected yet again, this time on the different yet similarly unreasonable basis that the form covering the Spring semester ( ending XX/XX/XXXX ) would, according to SoFi-XXXX   arbitrary three-month period policy, only cover the months of XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX and because it covered only two months and not three or more, it was invalid. \\n\\nAfter countless hours speaking with representatives from both institutions, I learned that XXXX ( whose agents had claimed SoFi had been responsible for all the decisions ) had forwarded only the first form to SoFi. XXXX representatives claimed SoFi had decision-making power over these forms, while SoFi claimed XXXX had decision-making power over the standing and reporting of my account. Over the course of these months, I had several long conversations with representatives, each promising me that the issue would be addressed and that I would be contacted once it had been resolved. Meanwhile, XXXX representatives continued to threaten me with reporting my account as delinquent to credit bureaus and continued to harass me every day on the telephone. It is clear that both institutions were colluding to coerce me into making payments that I am clearly not required to make under the loan agreement governing my loan. \\n\\nThe essential facts here are that I have been at all relevant times, and continue to be, a XXXX XXXX at a degree-granting program for a XXXX degree, and I have submitted several times documents attesting to this status, all in a timely and cooperative manner despite the unreasonable demands imposed upon me by SoFi-XXXX. SoFi-XXXX has rejected all these documents, each on distinct and unreasonable grounds and after unreasonable delays, citing so-called policies that are nowhere to be found in my loan agreement. As I have explained to several agents at SoFi-XXXX, SoFi-XXXX accepts forms only when signed by the university registrar. As I have explained to SoFi-XXXX several times, the university registrar can verify only that I am registered for classes for any given semester. My XXXX program operates on the semester system. Thus, there is a Fall semester and a Spring semester. There is no Summer semester. However, one does not cease being a student during the periods in which classes are not held. There is no summer term in my XXXX program and I am therefore not enrolled in classes over the summer, but I am nonetheless a XXXX   student. By the same token, one does not cease being a student on weekends or national holidays when classes are not held. I have submitted evidence of continued enrollment for the Fall XX/XX/XXXX term as further proof of my status and have also offered several times to have the dean of the college send in a letter attesting to my status if need be, evidence which would cover the summer months during classes are not held. However, SoFi-XXXX has declined to accept such evidence and has indicated that it accepts only documents signed by the university registrar. SoFi-XXXX has thus established and implemented a so-called policy that creates requirements that can not possibly be met. This is bad faith conduct, unreasonable, and not valid grounds for denying an in-school deferment under the loan agreement. \\n\\nPursuant to the terms of my loan agreement, which governs the rights and obligations of me and SoFi, I have the right to defer my loan if I am a XXXX XXXX. No specific policies are incorporated into that agreement, and at any rate, any policies not disclosed to me at the time I signed the loan agreement which are established and implemented by Sofi-XXXX in such a way as to vitiate my rights under that agreement are simply unenforceable. SoFi-XXXX might require submission of forms for deferment every three months, but they can not deny deferment simply because those arbitrary three-month periods do not coincide with the academic calendar of any given university. Likewise, Sofi-XXXX may require that the student status verifications be prepared by the university registrar, but they can not deny deferment on the ground that the universitys semesters do not coincide with the arbitrary three-mon period established by SoFi or XXXX when the registrar can only attest to course enrollment by semester. \\n\\nSection I.2 ( a ) of the loan agreement gives me the right to defer the loan if I return to school as a XXXX XXXX pursuing a graduate degree and submit evidence to that effect. They say nothing about being enrolled for courses, and the reason they dont is that being a student is not dependent on being enrolled in courses. The more general provision in Section I.1 stating that the decision to grant a request for forbearance is at the sole discretion of the lender arguably does not apply even by its terms because we are dealing with a deferment, not a forbearance. But in any case, even if it were intended to apply to deferment, it would not be applicable because the much more detailed Section 2 delineates specific requirements for in-school deferment, and specific provisions take precedence  over general ones in the event of discrepancy. In addition, Section I.2 ( a ) would serve absolutely no purpose if all decisions on deferment were at the sole discretion of the lender regardless of whether any specific requirements were met. In such a case, deferment would not be available to me even if I submitted reasonable evidence of student status, which Section I.2 ( a ) clearly contemplates. Provisions in contracts are not interpreted in such a way as to render other provisions meaningless. \\n\\nI have satisfied the requirements set forth in Section I.2 ( a ) of the loan agreement several times for the period in question and in a timely manner. The essential fact is that, in a degree-granting doctoral program, active course enrollment is not required to be considered a XXXXXXXX XXXX. This is why the loan agreement refers to being a student, not necessarily being enrolled in courses. If Sofi-XXXX contends I have not satisfied those requirements, then those requirements are unreasonable and Sofi-XXXX is violating the loan agreement. This is an act of bad faith, and good faith in executing contracts is implied no matter what the contracts terms. \\n\\nI have made interest payments as I had been since I became a XXXX XXXX for the periods in question as required of me by my loan agreement, as my loan is rightly in deferral. My loan is therefore in good standing, and any statement or conduct to any other effect by SoFi-XXXX is fraudulent.',\n",

I have been able to get a couple jobs in my industry throughout COVID however there have been many layoffs. SoFi has allowed us at least twice to pay less than our full payment, which has helped but at this point they said there is nothing more they can do for us, even though I lost my job last year. The last time I spoke with a representative at SoFi I asked her am I supposed to pay you instead of my mortgage and groceries? in order to not have another late ( s )? She basically shrugged my statement off. Now I am blessed more than many others in this country and around the world that my husband does work, however we still cant pay our monthly bills without me working as well. I have over {$90000.00} in student loan debt to pay, etc, etc. I need SoFi to do the right thing and remove the lates it is showing erroneously on our credit report. This company has been terrible to work with and does not have the consumers interest at heart. If this is happening to myself, I can not imagine how it might be affecting other families out there who are struggling to maintain their credit scores but keep food on their table.',\n",

SoFi puts out a lot of advertisement on how they can save people so much money with their student loans, and that is why I chose them. They only go up to a 20 year plan, and my loan is over  XXXX . Currently, my payments are around {$750.00} a month. I am  only one yea r out of graduating college and have a good job and have even been promoted twice, but I still am struggling mightily with these loans. You would be hard pressed to find someone 1 year out of college that would not be struggling to cover {$750.00} a month just for student loans. The student loan payment is more than my car payment plus rent combined. I have called them multiple times to ask what they can do to help me lower my payments because I am currently not saving any money, which was the whole point of doing this. Almost every other company can offer things like income-based payments or a longer term deal. Either way, I need a better payment structure ; every time I call them to ask what they can do to help they always tell me that there is nothing they can do. The y give one o ption which is to switch to a fixed rate. Well, that makes no sense because the current fixed rate is around 8 %. My current variable rate is around 5.5 %. Being on a variable rate can be very dangerous, especially for someone in my situation, but it is the only way I can possibly make any of these payments. The only other thing they mention besides switching to a fixed rate is to call  XXXX , who is actually servicing the loan. If I call  XXXX , they tell me to call SoFi. They just send you back and forth, and that is not a good look. I always ask them if they can push my term out t o 25 or   30 years, because that will definitely lower my payments. It would also be a GREAT business decision on their part, because they can make even more money off of interest from me over a 30 year span. To me, I understand that I a spending more money on interest, but that gives me more money to invest now, and also will allow me to breathe with lower payments. However, they always say that there is nothing they can do to help me. Plain and simple, I need a better payment structure. They are making money off of me no matter what, so there should not be any problem with switching up the payment structure. My current plan has a balance of around  XXXX  and has a projection of me spending a total of  XXXX  including interest over the life of the loan. That shows that they are going to be making a lot of money off of me. Surely they can do something to help me out given that I am helping them make so much money.

About XXXX CDT, on XXXX/XXXX/16, I checked the SoFi online portal, and it still showed my employment verification was missing. It had an option in the portal to upload an employment verification document. In the interest of thoroughness and redundancy, I requested a third employment verification from my employer, but this time I requested the document be sent directly to me. I received the document and the password, un-encrypted the document, and re-saved it. I then uploaded the un-encrypted document to the SoFi portal about XXXX XXXX, on XXXX/XXXX/16. Since that time, SoFi apparently has no record of receiving the previous two employment verification documents directly from my employer, nor a record of the SoFi employee I spoke with who verified the second employment verification.

Seeing as I have had my employer send two previous employment verification documents directly to them, I have refused to have my employer send them an employment verification a third time. SoFi \\'s lack of record-keeping and document accountability is alarming to me. I have provided them a lot of personally identifiable information ( PII ). How secure is the rest of that information if they ca n\\'t locate the previous two employment verification documents my employer sent them? I suspect there must be a standard financial institutions are required to adhere to in maintaining customer \\'s PII. I am concerned that SoFi does not have a practice of adhering to those standards. We have withdrawn our application from SoFi due to their poor record-keeping practices and insistence that I have my employer send them a third employment verification, but felt it prudent to file a complaint in the interest of all of their clients PII.',\n",

       "  'XX/XX/XXXX This is a follow up to complaint number XXXX. \\nThe response from SOFI and XXXX  has created more questions than will fit in a 100 word limit response. \\n\\nXXXX  : Was all the generous detailed instruction on how to read my \" personal credit report \\'\\' simply lip service to deceive the CFPB regulators that monitor this complaint process? \\nYou may have set a new low! I have spent 15 months requesting what is guaranteed to me by section 609 of the FCRA. At this point there must be a dozen requests via direct letters to you, the CFPB complaint process and multiple requests by the Office of the Attorney General West Virginia ( who you would not even respond to multiple requests ). As I said before you have refused to answer, stonewalled or have given evasive replies that have nothing to do with the request. In your last complaint response, how generous it was of you to provide such detailed instruction regarding my personal credit report. Things like inquiries shared with others and inquiries shared only with you. And the mention by federal law, your personal credit report must list all organizations that have requested you credit history. And now the big new low -- -you never sent my personal credit report to me. Was all the generous detailed instruction simply lip service to the CFPB regulators that monitor this complaint process? With your 15 month track record with me it would be foolish for anyone to give you the benefit of the doubt. Your response was written in complete bad faith. Just like in the past 15 months you had no intention of delivering my consumer disclosure and fulfilling your obligation as a CRA. It certainly appears you think you are above the law. \\nThis is all I want. A simple one word response on the CFPB, sent. At which time you send me my consumer disclosure meaning the long version of my file, the one only I can request, that list every inquiry on my file including promotional inquiries as well as all information that has been suppressed or edited/deleted for whatever reason. Considering you are footnoted in this definition on XXXX you know exactly what I want. This consumer disclosure will also be back dated to a previous request, complaint number XXXX, filed XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nSOFI : My letter to you dated XX/XX/XXXX indicated that I had 30 SOFI pulls on my XXXX  report. Your XXXX XXXX letter indicated your investigation could only \" ... identified three soft pulls. \\'\\' XX/XX/XXXX, you said in a company response : If you are seeing as many as XXXX soft credit inquiries on your credit, please contact XXXX  regarding these inquires. What you are telling me? Could you not find these 27 pulls in your file or were you not expecting them to be listed on my regular XXXX  credit report? What is the reason the pulls showed up on the report if that is the case? Your response on XX/XX/XXXX these 27 pulls that were unaccounted for have now have magically become prescreen mailer pulls. Obviously, prescreen mailers come with the legal record keeping and firm offer obligations under the FCRA. It appears you didnt have a record of these 27 pulls your XXXX XXXX response which is most likely the reason I never received offers/mailers from you. Also, pre-screen offers are designed as a cost effective way to market to consumers that meet whatever thresholds. SOFI must buy millions of names from the CRAs annually. To think that SOFI does a soft credit check on each name every time a mailer is sent would negate any cost efficiency and to think that each consumer would get a soft pull every mailer that would show on their report would result in a huge number of complaints. SOFI does not have a lot of complaints. So what happened?? \\nHere are a couple of questions from your previous complaint response. \\nFirst, when asked how you obtained my social security number you indicated it was not necessary for pulls? That being the case, your own website indicates in the absence of a social security number consent is required : Website : \" Did you know that a company can pull your credit information with just your name, address, date of birth, and consent? \\'\\' Could you please elaborate as to when, where, and who did you obtain my consent? I expect that the consent requirements are different between the XXXX separate soft pulls and the prescreen pulls discussed above. Please itemize. \\nSecond, you stated we began sending you direct mailers in XX/XX/XXXX. This is shortly after the XXXX  data breach which I responded to with the security freeze/opted out. Were you accessing my data through XXXX  prior to XX/XX/XXXX? If so when did it start, how many pulls and what are the details of my consent? \\nThird, as discussed, there are several ways the prescreen process works. The most common is the CRA provides the list. The other way is the creditor provides the consumers name to the CRA. Considering the date of the first mailer, did you migrate my name to XXXX  because you could no longer access my data through XXXX?\\n\\nFourth, like I said before, I do not recall receiving a single mailer from you in the past three years. And considering the XXXX  report indicates that these were sometimes sent twice a month SOFI should be a household name around here. As you know the FCRA requires a firm offer as well as record keeping. This being the case could you please tell what you were marketing to me? XXXX  tells me these 27 pulls were preapprovals. There seems to be a big difference between a mortgage preapproval and a credit card preapproval. You mention the word \" loan \\'\\' in previous correspondance, was someone indicating I was interested in a loan and providing you with my consent? \\n\\nI look forward to you response. \\nSincerely, XXXX',\n",

At that point, I was prompted for additional information, which I was not immediately able to provide. \\n\\nPrior to the 30-day window ending, I called Sofi in XX/XX/2022 to inquire about my application \\'s deadline. At that point, a service representative told me not to worry ; she stated that I had until XX/XX/2022 to submit the requested information, which would keep my offer valid. \\n\\nFast forward to the week of XX/XX/2022, and I submitted all of the requested information to complete my loan. This included my submission of paystubs, an income statement, and information pertaining to the loans I wished to refinance. Upon submission, I was prompted for a second hard inquiry, which caught me by surprise. As a result, I called Sofi \\'s customer service once more. \\nDuring this phone call, another Sofi representative told me that my original credit inquiry needed to be updated, since 30 days had lapsed. I informed him about the previous phone call I had, but he insisted that a second credit pull was unavoidable. He did, however, assure me that Sofi would honor the original rate of 3.695 %, despite a second hard inquiry credit pull. As a result, I pulled credit.\\n\\nShortly thereafter, I noticed that my offer changed on my Sofi portal. The new offer was for {$66000.00} at 5.465 %. This irked me, since I had recently checked my credit score from all three credit bureaus and saw that my scores had not changed from my previous credit score in XX/XX/2022. The new rate was also nearly two percentage points higher, which was not in line with with the previous representatives statement that \" Sofi would honor the original offer. \\'\\' This prompted yet another phone call to Sofi on XX/XX/2022. After communicating the above events, waiting for nearly an hour, and speaking with a manager, I was told that even though Sofi acknowledged that I had received \" miscommunication \\'\\' from its representatives, there was nothing Sofi could do to honor the original offer that I received. Frankly, I was told that I have to go forward with the new offer or take nothing. Additionally, Sofi could offer me no assurances that the hard credit inquiries I was hit with could be retracted. It truly felt like a bait and switch scheme.\\n\\nI want to express that I am very concerned with the above events. Altogether, I acted on information and assurances provided to me by Sofi representatives, and- in the end - I was penalized for it. Not only was I misinformed by the offer that was populating on my Sofi portal, but I was also misinformed by two unique Sofi service representatives at different points in time ; both led me to believe that I had ample time to finish providing additional information and that my original offer was still valid. In the end, I ended up with nothing but two hard inquiries that will ding my credit score, student loan debt at my existing rate, and a terrible consumer experience. What Sofi has done should not be legal. It it very unethical, and such practices negatively impact the financial well-being of consumers everywhere.',\n",

       "  'A very large company XXXX SoFi XXXX that refinances student loans is undoubtedly engaged in deceptive and predatory lending practices. I know this because I used them to refinance my student loans recently. They advertise interest rates that would clearly be interpreted by any reasonable person as annualized rates and even call the interest rates \" Annual Percentage Rates \\'\\' in the loan documents but they actually compound this rate on a daily basis, making the effective annualized rate significantly higher than that which is being advertised. I carefully reviewed the loan documents I received and only in one place, buried deep in the disclosure, does it say interest is accrued on a daily basis, and even that description is confusing because it fails to disclose that the actual interest rate a borrower will pay on an annual basis is higher than the \" Annual Percentage Rate \\'\\' because of the daily compounding of interest ( which I think is a very material omission ). I genuinely believe SoFi is secretly robbing indebted students of XXXX dollars PER STUDENT by engaging in these predatory tactics and I believe action needs to be taken against them immediately. SoFi includes a well-crafted arbitration clause in their loan documents and the clause prohibits class arbitration, which effectively prevents any borrower from bringing a claim against them. I would be happy to represent myself against them, and luckily the agreement states each party pays its own legal expenses unless a claim is frivolous, but the fees of the arbitrators would quickly dwarf the amount at issue in my individual case, WHICH IS WHY I NEED YOUR HELP. You are the only available remedy for these kinds of shameful, predatory tactics. SoFi is a HUGE ORGANIZATION and the effect of taking action against them would benefit XXXX students. You have the ability to do a lot of good here ; please do n\\'t just let it pass you by. This is wrong, legally and morally, and you should do something about it. If you agree to pay my share of the arbitrators \\' fees I would be happy to take up this cause myself and set a precedent against them ( though decisions in arbitration are n\\'t binding, it would still look very very bad for them and may encourage changes to their practices ) but I am not going out of pocket XXXX dollars more than I already am out of pocket because of these shady practices ; I really ca n\\'t afford that.',\n",

They promised me twice that I would not have a 30 day derogatory on my credit report and they will not lift the 30 day late. \\nI do not have any denial letter from them as they have not provided me anything in writing. I have tried desperately to ensure that my credit was not \" dinged \\'\\' and called Sofi IMMEDIATELY to keep my payments current and on time. Sofi refuses to fix the problem they advised me they would fix and lied to me. I am now seeking the help of the Federal Government to help me as the institution will not. \\n\\n\\n\\nHello XXXX - Needless to say this has now wound up with you. I will be contacting the CFPB if I do not receive a satisfactory response from someone at your firm with regards to my credit being corrected. \\n\\nHere is my story. \\nIn XX/XX/XXXX, I called to advise you of a payment that would bounce on my account. I had received notice on my side but on your side it did not show yet. I wanted to make a payment as soon as possible in order to avoid a 30 day late. \\nI made my payment over the phone as promised. When I called to make this payment, the associate said that if I made the payment that day I would avoid any kind of 30 day late ( you can pull the call recording ). \\n\\nLast week I pulled a copy of my credit report and noticed that my credit was reflecting a 30 day late. I was told that this would not happen, so I immediately called you all. \\n\\nI spoke with a man ( unfortunately I did not get his name ) who advised me that the issue would be resolved and that my credit would be fixed so as to not have a 30 day late on my credit report. He advised me that he would send me an email advising me of the correction. \\n\\nSince then, I have not received an email or phone call of any resolution from Sofi. \\nI then decided to email you all for status. The first email I received from XXXX told me to contact XXXX. Dead end. Ironially - I did file a dispute with all XXXX credit bureaus who advised me that the error would not be corrected. \\nThe second email I received from XXXX stated that they were unable to locate my account and to email from the email address on file, which I then did for my 3rd email. The email I received from XXXX stated that the record was \" true \\'\\' and that I could call you to discuss. \\n\\nI called yesterday to follow up and was on hold for about 20 minutes before I was disconnected. I called back and asked for a return call and the associate called but did not leave a message. \\nToday I called and was on hold for another 20 minutes before the associate advised me that they did not have anyone available ( for another 20 minutes ) and that they would call me back. \\n\\nNeedless to say this is an absolute headache. All I want is my credit fixed as promised. It appears no one wants to read notes to abide by what was promised to me. I made my payments on time and have done my part to always ensure that I am in good standing with you. I wish I could just get that in return. \\n\\nAgain, next stop will be CFPB if the response I receive is insufficient. The funny part about all this is that I was initially very impressed with your customer service. My husband and I are starting to shop around for a 1st mortgage and I considered contacting you all. After this experience, I will not be doing that. \\n\\nXXXX XXXX',\n",

Have you ever heard of 2 accounts paid only and directly to the original bank, been reported as failed to pay, loss, and on a collection agency, when all that is false? Have you ever heard on main bank reporting a certified payment agreement for a credit card with them, paid directly to them, to the original account number, never to a collection agency, and paid successfully as agreed for 48 months as the agreement has in writing, being reported as failed to pay, loss, collection, and even as of today, a credit report it still has remaining balance, after more extinguishing all procedures, starting with the same Bank, then the credit bureaus, then the CFPB, and then the 3 Federal Courts, but no one did anything? Have you ever heard of a main bank prohibiting a client to continue to pay a personal loan after it was fully updated directly with the same Bank, never to a collection agency, after years it was fully updated and paid as agreed for years after updated, in order to keep reporting without never updating the credit report it was a loss and under collection no matter it is false? All this and more was taken as a last resource to the Supreme Court of the U.S. as well as the F.B.I. Corruption Division where frauds by Banks are also investigated, but nothing is happening : Only the pre approval denial like yours at SoFi continue.\",\n",

       "  'I am a banking customer with this financial institution, and this is a complaint and report of improper and insufficient handling of a fraudulent transaction dispute. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I used my SoFi debit card to purchase a product online ( a bed frame, ) from a vendor \" XXXX XXXX \\'\\'. The transaction was successful and my account was charged in the amount of {$140.00}. Unfortunately, in the weeks that followed, it appeared quite obvious that I had become a victim of a scam. After not receiving a production on the expected time-frame, I reviewed my order and noticed several red flags : besides NOT receiving my product, the vendor \\'s website was offline, their \" customer support \\'\\' address was a private email address and, lastly, they had provided a fake tracking link. All of the above remains the case as of the date of this report. Anyone can verify this information as follows : The website address provided by the vendor : XXXX The XXXX  ( XXXX ) tracking number provided by the vendor : XXXX Therefore, I reported the fraudulent transaction to SoFi and opened a dispute via their customer service. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from the SoFi dispute department asking me to provide documentation of the above, and I did, and they claimed they would investigate. \\n\\nNearly two months later, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a followup email from SoFi, claiming that \" XXXX XXXX \\'\\' responded to them with a rebuttal to my claim, but SoFi refused to share the material that was supposedly supplied to them by the vendor. They said they they sent me an attachment, which I was unable to access. I called them the same day to complain about my inability to access the documentation, and they verbally explained that the vendor \\'s rebuttal consisted of them sending \" pictures of the product they sent \\'\\' ( as if that constituted a believable proof that the product was shipped???? ) and the customer support specialist admitted that this was a diversion tactic on the part of the vendor, but continued to refuse to give me access to this \" evidence \\'\\'. Instead, the support person vehemently insisted I reply to the email I received from SoFi and to state that I \" reject the rebuttal \\'\\' and when I continued to explain that I would - understandably - like to see WHAT evidence I am disagreeing with, they insisted I just reject. Even though I was visibly unhappy about the lack of proper customer support and I voiced my concern with my banking institution, I realized that they were giving me no choice, and that I had to disagree without seeing the evidence, if I wanted the investigation to continue. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, SoFi responded that they concluded nothing was wrong with the transaction and that they closed the investigation, in spite of it being obvious that they had not done their due diligence. They communicated that the investigation was closed, and offered no further assistance, including a possibility of an appeal. \\n\\nI immediately called them again, and I requested what was the extent of their research, and how could they credibly claim that this had been a legitimate transaction when they clearly had not conducted their research properly. Even just by accessing the information I provided above, it is clear that this vendor \\'s site continues to be offline, and that the tracking information indicates that the order has never been shipped, and therefore not delivered to my address either. As a matter of fact, SoFi customer support refused to substantiate their investigation in any way, only offering to send me a letter electronically, and I told them that this did not function in the past, and that I was owed an explanation. \\n\\nOnly after insisting and asking several times did the support specialist agree to escalate my complaint to a supervisor, by the name of XXXX XXXX. I revisited the details of the case with Mr XXXX, and he had promised that he would file an internal report and complaint about how this case had been handled by the bank, and also offered to send me the aforementioned evidence that ( supposedly ) had been sent to them by the fraudulent vendor. When I finally received that attachment later that day, it was simply a copy of my transaction that was provided by a third-party processor. Needless to say, it is evident and clearly verifiable from my bank account that I indeed paid for this item and that these funds were deducted from my account. That document was not only NOT the evidence SoFi had previously referred to verbally, it also did not it any way constitute a proof that this order had been fulfilled. \\n\\nI immediately complained about this by responded to Mr XXXX but have not received any communication from the bank since. \\n\\nIn closing, I am completely mortified by this banking institution utter lack of concern towards protecting their customer from fraudulent vendors. It was evident from all of my communication with the bank that they failed to conduct a proper investigation, and/or to supply any evidence of communication with the vendor as well as any proof of any research / investigation that they completed independently to determine that this was a legitimate transaction and that it had indeed been fulfilled as promised. \\n\\nTo this date, I have not been able to have any response from the vendor, as their website remains offline ( and, I suspect, will remain so indefinitely ) and the tracking information they provided in early XXXX, still appears inaccurate/ false on the shipper \\'s tracking website. \\n\\nIn doing so, SoFi is failing their customers. They are throwing us under the bus, while at the same time enabling bad actors to get away with fraud by failing to do their due diligence in properly investigating fraudulent transactions.',\n",

The credit score there was lower than any score I\\'ve ever had ( I frequently check - my score is typically in the 720-750 range, and this was less than 700 ) and noted serious delinquency. When I looked at my free credit report, there was no indication of any delinquency at all.

I was again told there is no record of my referral link being used even though I have a record of emailing my link to my wife and watching her open the account with my referral link. After I explained this to the SOFI customer service representative, she stated that SOFI recently went through a system update to fix a \" glitch or a bug \\'\\' in the system so the referral links would now work and their systems would recognize when the referral links are being used.

I asked to escalate to another manager, but he said there was no one else to escalate to. I finished my call at XXXX XXXX  CT after explaining I would file a complaint with the CFPB. My concern is that this is a known issue with SOFI and their are using deceptive acts to have customers open accounts and are not meeting the terms of the referral bonus because of a bug in their systems. Their Terms and Conditions should be considered null and void after I met the conditions of the referral bonus but their system glitch prevents SOFI from recognizing the referral link was used.

I was locked out of my account for suspicious activity ( which they stated ) Lies. There was nothing going on with my account. I opened my account in the middle of XX/XX/XXXX and I was locked out of my account on XX/XX/XXXX. I was sent email and was told to call the fraud department to get this issue resolved. I called the fraud department and left a message for them to contact me back. Someone called me 48 hours later and that was on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX was the rep that was over my account and he was apart of the Fraud Department team ( XXXX ) XXXX. As I am speaking with him he asked me to provide the names and number and address to the people who was sending me money and I did that. He begins to get frustrated and he started using profanity. I had no idea what was going on with him. I was soooooo upset. I hung up and called the customer service number ( XXXX ) XXXX and told them exactly what happened during that conversation and they were able to hear the recorded phone call as well. I filed a complaint against XXXX XXXX and they reassigned my account to someone else. Since that day I called them over and over again trying to get in touch with the person who is over my account XXXX. I called customer service and told them what was going on and they said that they had been calling me but I placed them on the do not call list. I do not do that at all. I am trying to resolve this issue but they\\'re lying. Side bar ( I read so many complaints on the XXXX  website and some consumers stated that Sofi stated they tried calling to leave them a message but they were placed on the \" Do Not Call List. \\'\\' They did that when I filed my complaint against XXXX XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I finally received a phone call from XXXX who is apart of the Fraud Department team. He asked me to verify who I was so he sent over a text and I had to click on a link to show my face and my ID that showed my name and address. I gave them my social that was also on file and he stated that is all that he needed to verify who I was. After that I haven\\'t heard anything from him. I was calling at least 2-3 times a week leaving messages, and sending out emails with the same lame response from them. I am fed up and I mean fed up. I was calling them XX/XX/XXXX ( 3x ) XX/XX/XXXX ( 2x ), XX/XX/XXXX ( 1 ), XX/XX/XXXX ( 1 ), XX/XX/XXXX ( 4x ) On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX I was fed up with this company. I called the Fraud Department and left a message and said \" I need someone to call me back asap because I am getting so sick and tired of calling and leaving messages and no one calls me back. I will file a lawsuit against this company. ) Someone called me from ( XXXX ) XXXX This man calls me and says \" Hi this is blank ( forgot his name ) from the Fraud Department the only person that needs to cops called on is you. You were not the one that opened the account this is not your account. \\'\\' I was so angry and upset. I called and filed a complaint against that man. He called me from a different number other than the number that are on file for Sofi. I was livid. I filed a complaint and still nothing has been done. I\\'ve called so many times in XXXX and in XXXX I stopped keeping track. I filed so many complaints and spoke with account specialist and they give me the same response. I told them if there was an issue with the deposit reverse the transaction so the sender can send me the money another way. I spoke with the sender and she stated that Sofi called her and she verified her identity and they also locked her out of her Sofi Money Market account. I am over this! They could reverse the transaction and close my account, close the account and send me the check or send the sender the check, or reopen the account. But no they refuse to do anything. The account wasn\\'t even open for 2 months and they have a 6 month investigation going on.

       "  'I contacted SoFi regarding an advertised Student loan rate of 1.91 %. \\n\\nI was really excited to see SoFi \\'s advertise 1.91 % on student loan \\'s and went through the registration and application process immediately. Sadly the \" best \\'\\' rate thy were able to over me was 3.825 % on a variable 5 year loan. \\n\\nI took a screen shot of the advertisement XXXX The rate quote did n\\'t pull credit score which I was surprised about but I know my credit is really high. Since they did n\\'t pull a credit score, I also went through and try numerous permutations of of the rate quote matrix to try and see what did land the 1.91 % percent but never got below 3.825 %. \\n\\nAfter that I decided to email SoFi and see if they could answer what it takes to get that rate. \\n\\nSo I wrote them : Hi SoFi, I am trying to learn how to obtain the 1.91 % APR you \\'ve listed : Currently when I go through the Find My Rate page, I only see 3.825 % as my lowest option. For footnote # 1, you do n\\'t spell out anything regarding the credit worthiness of the borrower : Fixed rates from 3.50 % APR ( with AutoPay ) to 7.49 % APR ( without AutoPay ). Variable rates currently from 1.91 % APR ( with AutoPay ) to 5.45 % ( without AutoPay ). Interest rates on variable rate loans are capped at either 8.95 % or 9.95 % depending on term of loan. See APR examples and terms. Lowest variable rate of 1.91 % APR assumes current 1 month XXXX rate of 0.20 % plus 1.71 % margin. If approved for a loan, the fixed or variable interest rate offered will depend on your credit history and the term of the loan and will be within the ranges of rates listed above. For the SoFi variable rate loan, the 1-month XXXX index will adjust monthly and the loan payment will be re-amortized and may change monthly. APRs for variable rate loans may increase after origination if the XXXX index increases. The SoFi 0.25 % AutoPay interest rate reduction requires you to agree to make monthly principal and interest payments by an automatic monthly deduction from a savings or checking account. The benefit will discontinue and be lost for periods in which you do not pay by automatic deduction from a savings or checking account. \\n\\nAPR examples and terms also does not spell out the criteria needed to qualify for such a rate. I ask because I feel like I \\'m an ideal candidate for such a low rate, my debt-to-income is less than 10 %, I \\'ve been at my job for more than 10 years and my credit score is very high. \\n\\nTheir response Thank you for your email. The 1.90 % rate is for our 5 year variable term. SoFi considers a variety of factors based on your personal circumstances at the time of application. When making a decision about your application & resulting terms and conditions we consider, but are not limited to your : -credit profile -total gross income -years of work experience -debt burden capacity analysis My response : Hi XXXX, Credit profile is n\\'t pulled when I go through your rate finder so I do n\\'t see how this is possibly a variable when quoting. \\nTotal gross income - How much? \\nI have the maximum years work experience selected ( XXXX ) My debt burden analysis, or my debt-to-income as most financial institutions call it is less than 10 %. \\n\\nI want the 1.90 % but I \\'m looking for specifics regarding what it takes to get it, so far it \\'s very ambiguous - please advise. \\n\\nTheir response In order for you to receive your preapproval rates, Sofi performs a soft credit check, which does not affect your credit but does give insight into your credit history. As far as the other factors that are taken into account when deciding your rate, we do not provide any more specifics as they are part of our underwriting criteria which we do not disclose.

I will not lie to my bank, nor will I lose the {$400.00} in gains that I made using the {$960.00}.

I want my money, XXXX {$1500.00} returned to me immediately by check or as a transfer to another trading platform. I shouldn't have to wait 6 months for only a percentage of my money to be returned. I saved for a long time to have this money to invest since I don't have a retirement plan. This sets me back 6 months, but likely.much much longer.

During the application process, I made it clear that I was under review by the Veterans Affairs for a XXXX XXXX. I specifically asked several times how my XXXX status from the Veterans Affairs would affect my loan and application. I also asked if it could be counted as income because I expected to be assessed at XXXX XXXX. Every time I asked him about my XXXX status, he changed the subject or reminded me that the longer I waited, the higher my rate would be. He kept saying it was a standard agreement. I was never once warned of the rights I was about to give up by turning my Federal Student Loan over to SoFi as a XXXX veteran. That should have been an immediate red flag for the representative to make me aware of that fact. They did, however, threaten me with an increased rate if I didnt make a decision quickly. I felt pressured and rushed to give them an answer. I was told about a month after signing the contract, as expected, I was assessed for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX by the XXXX XXXX. I am a XXXX XXXX XXXX, but now SoFi states that I have given up my rights to student loan forgiveness. \\n\\nAfter I received XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, I called SoFi to inquire about the process on how to apply for federal student loan forgiveness, they told me that I was ineligible. After several phone calls and denials, I reported them to the Better Business Bureau in XX/XX/XXXX. SoFi replied with this statement : The applicant applied for a Student Loan Refinance on XX/XX/XXXX, all necessary underwriting was completed by XX/XX/XXXX. SoFi placed a call to the applicant on XX/XX/XXXX advising his loan acceptance packet was ready to sign. When SoFi makes an outbound call to advise a loan is available to sign, the SoFi representative encourages the Applicant to review the document before signing. In section 3.C of the Loan Acceptance Document, the loss of loan forgiveness benefits is outlined. It identifies specific individuals as follows borrowers pursuing careers in Public Service, Teaching and/or the Armed Forces. As a private lending corporation, SoFi does not participate in Federal Loan Forgiveness programs. \\n\\nThey used the portion of the contract that stated borrowers pursuing careers in Public Service, Teaching and/or the Armed Forces. This did n\\'t pertain to me because it pertains to someone \" pursuing \\'\\' these professions. I completed my service to my country over 10 years before I applied for this refinancing and did n\\'t plan to pursue careers in Public Service, Teaching and/or the Armed Forces in the future. I now know why they used scare tactics and rushed me to sign. It is their practice to intice Veterans with low-interest rates and deny us of our rights once the contract is signed. They hide behind contract verbiage that does n\\'t pertain to Veterans whose service was honorably completed several years before applying for this loan. \\nIf I was not deceived and threatened by the salesman with losing the loan, I would have waited the 3 months that it took to get my decision from Veterans Affairs. I did not have any reason to rush refinancing my loan. \\nAs shown in the documentation attached you can see that my XXXX XXXX XXXX rating effective date was backdated to XX/XX/XXXX. This date is 4 months prior to applying for this loan.',\n",

I uploaded all of the necessary documents XXXX pay stubs, copy of driver \\'s license ) and submitted to underwriting. \\n\\nTo my surprise my application was denied due to \" poor credit performance with Sofi \\'\\'. I have had three loans with Sofi and never missed a payment. I have never missed a payment on any loan and have a credit score of XXXX. When I called to question why I was not approved, I was basically told that the decision was based on a black box calculation and because the customer service representatives are not loan originators, they could not help me. They said that if I were to apply to refinance my loan instead that I might have a better chance. I started a refinance application and was given another pre approval with a rate of 11.60 % on a 60 month loan. \\n\\nMy first issue is that I was pre approved for the loan and know that Sofi must have information regarding my credit history to give me that designation. My credit is clean and I have not taken on more debt since originating my last loan with Sofi. As a current loan holder and much of my information pre-populated, I was led to believe that Sofi already knew my credit history through a commonplace \" soft pull \\'\\'. How is it that I could be denied for \" poor credit performance with Sofi \\'\\' if I have never been late on a payment and am actually paying {$260.00} extra per month on my current loan. By misleading me that I was pre approved and allowing Sofi to run my credit, I have hurt my credit score and made it less likely that I will be approved by another lender. \\n\\nMy second issue is the discrepancy between the rates I was given for the loan I was denied and the refinancing rate. It seems to me that they are gouging me based on my current rate. Presumably they would have no further information on my credit history for this refinance application than they had on the loan I was declined for.

In XXXX they raised my variable interest loan up to 7.18 % from 3.55 % the previous month. I notified them of the error and it was corrected down to 2.98 %. I didnt want to make a big stink about it going up XXXX % for a few days so I let that go after it was fixed. \\n\\nThen in XXXX I applied for an economic hardship ( XX/XX/20 ) forbearance as a result of medical bills I received. They sent me the form via e-mail & instructed me to return it via my dual authenticated account online. After I completed the form and uploaded it as instructed, they denied the claim without cause communicated to me. I reached out & they indicated said without an actual signature they couldnt approve it. I asked them for alternatives because I dont have a printer and didnt think it made much sense for me to go to fedex to pay for printing in the midst of a pandemic and while applying for an economic hardship forbearance. Further, working for a financial institution myself, I know theyve had months to figure out alternatives to solve for this exact situation so that customers dont have to leave their houses or interact with strangers in the midst of a pandemic. \\n\\nDespite their lack of assistance, I was able to have my fianc print the form I needed to sign & uploaded it with the requested signature a few days later. It was submitted prior to my due date & I received notification of the forbearance being approved on XX/XX/20 the same way i became aware of the denial previously. \\n\\nDespite the approval, they still took the money from my account. I called them and told them I needed the money & wouldnt be able to buy groceries unless it was returned. They told me they would process the refund immediately. A week went by, and my checking account was still over drafted because of the payment they took. I called back and they told me they actually HAD NOT processed the refund the week before, and would process it that day. At that point I reached out to my bank to file a dispute because the loan was in forbearance when they withdrew the money and i wanted the overdraft fees refunded also. XXXX botched the refund, and have now the set my principle balance higher than its been since XXXX despite the fact that Ive been making interest payments all along. I should not have to pay interest on the same principle balance more than once as a result of their mistake. Ive asked multiple times for the balance to be returned to the amount quoted in the forbearance agreement. \\n\\nIm concerned that their servicing contract with the federal government has made SoFi customers less of a priority for XXXX, and operational errors like this are more likely to occur moving forward with any additional volume.',\n",

       "  'Monday XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX I answered my cell phone and talked with a person who identified herself as an employee of XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX. ( every other day of the week, and after XXXX  or XXXX XXXX on Mondays, I usually can not answer my phone personally because I am working. ) The XXXX employee informed me they filed a suit in court on behalf of SOFI, my private student loan company, regarding a {$37000.00} student loan. I asked to return their call within the hour. I wanted to get to a better location so that I could discuss my situation and hear what they had to say. I told the XXXX person I was so thankful to hear from them because I had tried repeatedly to resolve my SOFI student loan problem in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. I explained I had never heard from SOFI since my conversation with the SOFI XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX loan servicing manager XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. In my phone conversation with XXXX  on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX had said he thought he could help me and that perhaps there had been a miscommunication between XXXX and SOFI. He said he would reach out to SOFI \\'s servicing partners in reference to my student Loan 1 disbursed XX/XX/XXXX and my student Loan 3 disbursed XX/XX/XXXX. I told the XXXX person I had been waiting to hear back from XXXX XXXX or someone from SOFI. When I called back, I was put on hold, transferred to the wrong department and misunderstood repeatedly, but was finally able to connect with someone at XXXX who could talk with me regarding my SOFI loan and the suit filed against me. When I asked her to explain what was happening, I was told I needed to pay {$37000.00} immediately or the suit would go to \" judgement. \\'\\' When told her I had repeatedly asked SOFI to resolve the situation and even tried several times to contact XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX she gave no explanation as to why it was so hard for me to contact them. When I asked why I had no other phone calls from XXXX, no contact from them even though I had left phone messages in XX/XX/XXXX, she explained that their privacy policy does not allow them to leave a message on a voicemail which does not have a greeting which specifically identifies the recipient of the message. I explained that I did get a letter recently but it referenced SOFI filing suit and I was trying to get in touch with SOFI to find out what was going on. When I explained that I could not afford this kind of a payment having no assets ( I am in the process of applying to XXXX XXXX  and incurred the loans in a XX/XX/XXXX at University of XXXX that I completed in XXXX ) she then suggested that I could pay within 24 months and then later she suggested 36 months. I replied that I was very interested in repaying my loan, as I always have been, but given my financial situation, the most I could possibly afford at this time was approximately {$250.00} a month. She said this would not be acceptable but to take another look at my finances and call her back. When I told her that I had been trying to resolve this situation with SOFI since XX/XX/XXXX and that I had repeatedly communicated with SOFI directly and as well as XXXX, the SOFI loan servicer, she was not interested in helping me resolve the situation with SOFI. \\nI have experienced this same intransigent attitude with XXXX and SOFI over the past several years, especially in regards to these two loans. SOFI has chosen to interpret the clause \" deferment terms at the discretion of the lender \\'\\' in these two loan agreements in a very narrow way. \" Deferment terms at the discretion of the lender \\'\\' are interpreted as 12 months total of deferment options. This 12 month limitation is not exactly stated in my loan agreement. I discovered this limitation on forbearance options in XX/XX/XXXX. Until this time, SOFI was very gracious as I worked with their career and job development department to complete the necessary requirements to regain my XXXX license and seek a better paying job than my XXXX position. As long as I kept my career coaching appointments and did my homework assignments, my loans were kept in forbearance. I greatly appreciated this novel approach to a student loan company and student relationship. On XX/XX/XXXX I submitted a General Forbearance Request for Loan 1 and 3 and upon calling on XX/XX/XXXX was told there would be no more forbearance on Loan 1 and that Loan 3 was in Economic Deferment until XX/XX/XXXX. This was confusing and upsetting. But that same day, my XXXX year old mother fell and XXXX XXXX XXXX. The emergency room physician at the small hospital where she was initially treated told us there was no treatment for her and that she would XXXX XXXX XXXX of her XXXX. Over the next week we debated as a family to pursue XXXX and decided to go ahead with XXXX XXXX XXXX in spite of the risk. The day of her XXXX I spoke with a XXXX representative who called about my overdue loan from the hospital hallway outside of her room. I was her XXXX XXXX XXXX through the rest of the summer and did not return home until late XX/XX/XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX I submitted a General Forbearance Request for all three loans with a letter and additional supporting documentation expressing my desire and commitment to repay my loans. I also explained that my primary employment was still as a XXXX and XXXX. However, I had regained my XXXX XXXX license and increased my XXXX XXXX employment. XX/XX/XXXX, in a telephone call with XXXXXXX at XXXX, regarding the status of my forbearance request, I was told that my forms were uploaded on XX/XX/XXXX and approved the day before for a suspension of payments which would begin XX/XX/XXXX for 3 months, until XXXX XXXX. He advised me to request a refinance of my loans under a 20 year option and explained that I would need to contact SOFI directly at XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX I discovered Loan 1 and 3 were 7 days past due. Calling XXXX, I talked with XXXX  who told me that Loan 1 and 3 had only 12 months of forbearance-according to how SOFI interpreted my loan agreement, unlike my third student loan with SOFI- Loan 2 disbursed XX/XX/XXXX, which has three years worth of forbearance options. He suggested I contact SOFI and request refinancing. I called SOFI and talked with XXXX  who helped me to submit my request for refinancing. My request was denied, my loans were not eligible for this kind of option. At this time, I had gained enough work to be able to make a monthly payment and somehow avoided going into default status. XX/XX/XXXX I submitted a General Forbearance Request with a  letter and additional documentation explaining that I was working hard to increase my employment through XXXX XXXX but had only gained temporary employment. XX/XX/XXXX I submitted a General Forbearance Request online specifically for the period XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX with a letter of explanation and proof of income. This was granted. XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted a General Forbearance Request with a letter explaining that the temporary work was unstable but that I had been hired in a full time position and needed a little more time to stabilize financially and move through the probationary period. I did not include additional documentation with this request because I had been told earlier by a XXXX representative that it was not needed. This request was denied. No explanation was included with the denial letter and I assumed XXXX/SOFI had changed their minds and decided to stick to their original insistence that only 12 months of forbearance were available for Loan 1 and 3. XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with XXXX regarding my denial and learned that a {$440.00} payment was due on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX for Loan 3 and a {$600.00} payment was due on XX/XX/XXXX for Loan 1. At this time my car broke down unexpectedly on the XXXX outside of XXXX resulting in a {$500.00} towing bill and {$3000.00} repair bill. I was able to pay the towing but needed to borrow from friends to mange to pay the repair bill. By the end of XX/XX/XXXX, I saved enough to make a loan payment. I called XXXX XX/XX/XXXX to make a payment of {$500.00} and was told I only owed {$120.00}. Astonished I asked why and was given the details regarding only Loan 2. Asking regarding Loan 1 and 3, the XXXX person told me no such loans existed and suggested I was mistaken. She refused to pursue the matter with her supervisor. I could not reach anyone at SOFI who could help me. XX/XX/XXXX I sent a letter to XXXX imploring them to work with me regarding loan 1 and 3 and sending more documentation regarding my monthly bills and employment. XX/XX/XXXX I talked with XXXX  at XXXX who located the loans in their system. He said I needed to wait a couple days to find out what was going on. He also looked at my XX/XX/XXXX General Forbearance Request and told me that it was never forwarded to SOFI because supporting documentation was not included. He encouraged me to file again and contact SOFI directly. I could not get through to anyone at SOFI regarding my situation so I called XXXX and XXXX connected me directly to SOFI and I was able to talk with XXXX. XXXX was very encouraging! He thought there was a good possibility that SOFI would make a way for me to pay on Loan 1 and Loan 3.  He assured me that I would receive a call from SOFI. I did not. XX/XX/XXXX, I called SOFI and talked with XXXX. XXXX told me that one loan was in transition to XXXX, a collection litigation firm at XXXX XXXX and someone at SOFI would ask them to get in contact with me. She was not sure about the other loan, it was not showing up in her system. She talked about getting the two loans out of default status through SOFI talking with loan servicing. XXXX did not call me. I also talked with XXXX  at SOFI that day who told me that XXXX had discharged the loans not SOFI and that the Forbearance was denied because of a lack of documentation-a technical detail. She told me the loans were \" pushed \\'\\' into collection with XXXX and that I needed to contact them. Calling XXXX that evening, I spoke to XXXX  regarding the nature of the missing documentation. He said, contrary to what I had been told up to that point in time by various XXXX representatives over the last year, that what XXXX was looking for in documentation was not common house bills but a bill change like a large medical bill or a reduction in work hours. He asked if I had any unexpected expenses and I remembered my car breakdown and the towing and repair bill. He encouraged me to resubmit a new General Forbearance Request to XXXX documenting the car expenses and requesting they back date it to XX/XX/XXXX. I submitted a new General Forbearance Request with a letter and documentation that day, XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I spoke with XXXX at SOFI. He told me that SOFI let XXXX know I want to pay the loans and get back on track. Calling XXXX to confirm they had received this information, I spoke to a XXXX representative who reviewed my General Forbearance Request regarding Loans 1 and 3 sent XX/XX/XXXX and the communication from SOFI. This person told me SOFI was  not referring to loans 1 and 3 but to loan 2. This did not make sense because Loan 2 was in good standing at this time and still is and did not need to get back on track! I asked to speak with the supervisor. The XXXX supervisor told me there was no information in my file about reversing loans 1 and 3 out of default. She said that in order for XXXX to take my student loans 1 and 3 out of default status SOFI must direct them to do so. I then called SOFI again and told them what happened with the XXXX call. I was told that the loan servicing department at SOFI could make that decision, but I needed to call back and ask to be connected directly to the loan serving department. I did call back repeatedly and was told each time that the loan servicing department was not available. On XX/XX/XXXX I called SOFI again. I was told that my General Forbearance Request was \" in progress. \\'\\' I asked to be connected to the servicing department. This time I was connected to XXXX  at the SOFI servicing department who said I had no loans with SOFI! Calling XXXX back, I talked with XXXX who said that Loan 1 and 3 were charged off but that they could be brought out of default status if notification was received from the lender. XXXX suggested a conference call with SOFI, XXXX and myself. During this conference call XXXX at XXXX suggested XXXX at SOFI talk with her supervisor who then confirmed I did have previous loans with SOFI : loan 1 and 3.  However, this supervisor said I needed to talk to an upper level supervisor at SOFI and then have that person reach out to a SOFI person at XXXX. I was then connected to XXXX  in XXXX XXXX XXXX, an upper level manager in the loan servicing department at SOFI. This brings me back to the beginning of my story with the kind words spoken by this manager and the assurances given to me that he would reach out to the servicing partners to find out more information and email me by the next day XX/XX/XXXX. As I told the XXXX person, I have heard nothing from XXXX  at SOFI,  even though I have tried to reach him through SOFI, until the letter I received and the phone conversation with the XXXX representative. \\nThis has been a very long explanation. I hoped to give you an idea of how hard I have tried to communicate with XXXX and SOFI in the midst of family responsibilities and building my employment hours. I believe XXXX, SOFI and  XXXX have colluded to deny me a timely humane resolution to this problem and would greatly appreciate your help in resolving this problem.',\n",

At no point was I advised that I was actually applying for the loan as the site left the impression I was checking the rates. \\nWhen attempting to access the Adverse Action letter, I was directed to call as the reason was \" other \\'\\'. When I called SoFI I was informed that the denial was due to my credit score was too low and my debt utilization is too high. I asked for the minimum credit score, but was advised that the required score is proprietary. I also explained that there is no adverse action letter on my account and that I expected the denial to be put in writing. The customer service agent explained that I can view in my account and seemed unconcerned when I said that it was not available online. She offered to send it to me via email, but the email I received from her only directs me back to the original link inside of the SoFI account.',\n",

       "  'I started at University of XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX for a XXXX  in XXXX XXXX and successfully put my loan into deferment for three months ( the maximum amount allowed ). Around the time that the three months were up, I submitted another deferment request, because I was still in school. \\nOn XX/XX/XXXX the deferment request was denied because it was not within 30 days of the end date of the original deferment. I received the notification on XX/XX/XXXX. \\nI then submitted another request 1 day before the 30 days started because I figured processing with my school would take at least a day. It was denied on XX/XX/XXXX because there were missing dates of enrollment, however, the national student clearinghouse sent the correct forms with the application. I received this notification XX/XX/XXXX. \\nI submitted another deferment request again after the 30 days began and it was denied on XX/XX/XXXX because it was not within the 30 days of the end date of the other deferment. I had submitted it after the 30 days but since it was signed and dated for the day before the 30 days, they denied the request. I received this notice on XX/XX/XXXX. \\nI then submitted the deferment request for the FOURTH TIME. It was denied on XX/XX/XXXX again due to it not providing a program of study. I received this notification on XX/XX/XXXX. By this point it was so close to XXXX so I was unable to get anything done with my school since everyone was gone on break so I had to wait until after office personnel came back at University of XXXX. By this time it was XX/XX/XXXX. \\nAt this point, I was in direct contact with one person from the registrars office and she sent the deferment request 4-5 times to Sofi/XXXX by fax and by e-mail. The only record that Sofi/XXXX  has of this is XX/XX/XXXX which they took no action and XX/XX/XXXX which they also took no action. I finally got frustrated and asked the registrar lady to just send me the forms directly so I could up load them onto my account homepage. This was against their protocol but she agreed because, I assume, she understood how much trouble this had been for me. \\nI submitted the deferment request again for the FIFTH TIME on XX/XX/XXXX through the Sofi/XXXX  website and I made sure to contact Sofi/XXXX  when I submitted it to make sure everything was filled out correctly. They assured me that it would and that I would not be penalized for this since my account has been past due since I have been waiting for this deferment to go through. \\nOn XX/XX/XXXX they contacted me because my account was past due and that was when they informed me that the dates were not filled out correctly AGAIN. I was forced to pay a month of my loan which I really cant afford right now and now I have to submit this deferment request again. Also, apparently I was given the incorrect information by the previous two Sofi/XXXX personnel who told me that if my deferment request was approved it would retroactively be applied through the month of XXXX. That was not true, thus the reason I had to pay for a month of student loans that I truly can not afford. \\nI am submitting this complaint because Sofi/XXXX have failed to acknowledge my in-school deferment requests. They have created such a burden on me and my school by denying my requests over and over again knowing full well that I am currently in school. I have been prompt with every one of my filings and deferment requests but because of their incompetence, my account is now 37 days past due. I have done everything in my power to get them to accept my deferment requests, but they have utterly failed to perform even the most basic of tasks.',\n",

Additionally, SoFi advertised via chat and their website that they had a rate match guarantee and would also give {$100.00} along with a rate match. My existing rate was lower than what SoFi showed me after I submitted my information. I asked via chat how to take advantage of the rate match guarantee. I was advised to email my proof of lower rate to SoFi 's customer service. I did so immediately, sending over my last student loan statement and loan approval letter from a couple months ago with my current lender. Two days later I had no response from SoFi, so I contacted customer service via chat. The representative confirmed the documentation I sent over and said all that was remaining was completing my application, which included a hard credit pull. I completed the application, and once SoFi approved it at their initial advertised rate, I returned to chat to have my current lower rate applied per the match guarantee. The new representative said that SoFi would not match existing loans, and that I needed a current rate offer from a competitor. This was different than what had been stated earlier the same day by a different representative. Based on the earlier communication, I only agreed to allow SoFi to hard pull my credit and submit my application under the understanding that SoFi would match my lower rate based on the documentation I submitted.\\n\\nAs of now, I have a ding on my credit and SoFi has changed their stance on what they told me re the match guarantee and promotional credit.\",\n",
